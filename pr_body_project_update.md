## Update PROJECT.md with Premortem Analysis Findings

This PR updates PROJECT.md to reflect the critical findings from the premortem analysis and establishes realistic expectations for CRAN submission.

### Background
The premortem analysis revealed significant gaps between our current status assessment and the reality required for successful CRAN submission. This PR updates PROJECT.md to reflect these findings.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Status Update
- **From**: "EXCELLENT - Very Close to CRAN Ready"
- **To**: "CRITICAL BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED - Premortem Analysis Required"

#### 2. Timeline Reality Check
- **From**: "1-2 weeks to CRAN"
- **To**: "3+ weeks minimum (with critical blockers)"

#### 3. Confidence Level
- **From**: "HIGH"
- **To**: "LOW until blockers resolved"

#### 4. Test Coverage Accuracy
- **From**: "83.41% (good progress toward 90% target)"
- **To**: "78.15% (insufficient for production - target 90%)"

#### 5. Critical Issues Update
**Added new critical blockers:**
- **Privacy & Ethical Issues**: CRAN submission blockers - could result in package removal
- **Performance & Stability**: Segmentation faults could make package unusable
- **CRAN Compliance**: R CMD check notes are blockers, not minor
- **Real-World Testing**: Package may fail with actual data
- **Documentation Gaps**: Could hurt adoption

#### 6. New Documentation Section
Added comprehensive section on premortem analysis including:
- Critical findings summary
- Action plan document references
- Implementation timeline
- Next steps

### Impact
This update:
- Establishes realistic expectations for CRAN submission
- Identifies critical blockers that must be resolved

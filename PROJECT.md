## Using GitHub Projects/Issues for Tracking Progress

### GitHub Issues
- **Create an Issue:** Go to the "Issues" tab in your repo and click "New issue."
- **Title & Description:** Use clear, descriptive titles. In the description, provide context, steps to reproduce (for bugs), or acceptance criteria (for features).
- **Labels:** Use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`, etc.
- **Assignees & Milestones:** Assign issues to yourself or collaborators, and link them to milestones (e.g., "CRAN Submission").
- **Checklists:** Use markdown checklists for multi-step tasks.

### GitHub Projects
- **Create a Project:** Go to the "Projects" tab and click "New project." Choose "Board" for a Kanban-style layout.
- **Columns:** Set up columns like "Backlog", "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", "Done".
- **Add Issues/PRs:** Drag and drop issues or pull requests onto the board, or create new cards directly.
- **Track Progress:** Move cards as work progresses. You can filter by assignee, label, or milestone.

### Workflow Example
1. **Break down your project plan into issues:**  
   - "Refactor function names for clarity"
   - "Add roxygen2 documentation to all exported functions"
   - "Expand test coverage to 90%"
   - "Prepare for CRAN submission"

2. **Assign issues to milestones:**  
   - "CRAN v1.0 Release"

3. **Organize issues in a Project board:**  
   - Move issues from "To Do" to "In Progress" as you work on them, and to "Done" when finished.

4. **Reference issues in commits and pull requests:**  
   - Use `Fixes #12` in a commit or PR description to automatically close the issue when merged.

  - Naming convention: `hotfix/description`
  - Created from `main`
  - Merged to `main` and `develop`

### Git Workflow
- [ ] Commit conventions:
  - Type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
  - Scope: package, function, or component
  - Description: imperative, present tense

  - Risk: Package becomes unusable with large transcripts
  - Mitigation: Implement chunking, add progress bars, document memory requirements
  - Monitoring: Add performance benchmarks

- [ ] **Dependency Issues**
  - Risk: Key dependencies become deprecated or incompatible
  - Mitigation: Document minimum versions, test with multiple versions
  - Monitoring: Set up dependency update alerts

### Project Risks
- [ ] **Scope Creep**
  - Risk: Project becomes too complex to maintain
  - Mitigation: Define clear MVP, document feature requests separately
  - Monitoring: Regular scope reviews

- [ ] **Documentation Debt**
  - Risk: Documentation falls behind code changes
  - Mitigation: Make documentation part of PR requirements
  - Monitoring: Regular documentation audits

- [ ] **Testing Gaps**
  - Risk: Critical bugs slip through
  - Mitigation: Implement test coverage requirements
  - Monitoring: Regular test coverage reports

### User Experience Risks
- [ ] **Learning Curve**
  - Risk: Package is too complex for target users
  - Mitigation: Create detailed tutorials, add helper functions
  - Monitoring: User feedback collection

- [ ] **Data Privacy**
  - Risk: Accidental exposure of sensitive student data
  - Mitigation: Implement strict data handling, add anonymization
  - Monitoring: Regular security audits

### Maintenance Risks
- [ ] **Bus Factor**
  - Risk: Single point of failure in maintenance
  - Mitigation: Document all processes, encourage contributions
  - Monitoring: Regular contributor check-ins

- [ ] **Version Compatibility**

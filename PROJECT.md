# Project Plan: zoomstudentengagement

> **ü§ñ For AI Assistants**: Before starting work, run `./scripts/save-context.sh` to get current project status and avoid working on already-resolved issues.

## Overview
A package to analyze and visualize student engagement from Zoom transcripts, aimed at instructors and educational researchers.

- See also: `docs/planning/SPINOFF_PROJECTS_PLAN.md` for the spin-off projects roadmap and grouped issues.

## Goals
- Prepare for CRAN submission
- Improve documentation and usability
- Ensure robust testing and error handling

## Lean issue/branch workflow (no Projects board)

Decision: manage work directly via Issues, Milestones, Labels, and PRs. No Projects board automation.

- Labels: keep small, consistent set (priority:high/medium/low; area:*; documentation; refactor; test; privacy; status:blocked/in-progress/needs-review)
- Milestones: CRAN-aligned only (Code Quality & Style, Documentation Complete, Testing & Coverage (>90%), CI/QA Green, CRAN Preflight, Release 0.1.0)
- Definition of Done: unchanged; enforce via PR template and CI
- Process:
  - Create/triage issues weekly; label, assign, attach milestone
  - Each PR links an issue (Closes #X); PR template checklist must pass
  - Use saved issue filters instead of a board (e.g., `is:open label:"priority:high" -label:"status:blocked"`)

## Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-20)
**Package Status: EXCELLENT - Very Close to CRAN Ready**

### üö® **Critical Ethical Research Findings**
A comprehensive ethical analysis conducted on 2025-08-04 revealed **CATASTROPHIC risks** that must be addressed before CRAN submission, despite excellent technical metrics. See `docs/development/ethical-issues-research/ETHICAL_ISSUES_ANALYSIS.md` for complete analysis.

**Key Findings:**
- **Privacy & Ethical Issues**: CATASTROPHIC risk - Could result in CRAN removal and academic backlash
- **Performance & Stability**: HIGH risk - Segmentation faults could make package unusable in production
- **CRAN Compliance**: HIGH risk - Current notes are blockers, not minor issues
- **Real-World Testing**: HIGH risk - Package may fail with actual data
- **Documentation Gaps**: MEDIUM risk - Could hurt adoption and usability

**Bottom Line**: DO NOT SUBMIT TO CRAN YET - Package has critical privacy, ethical, and performance risks that must be addressed before submission.

### üéØ **Current Critical Priority: Issue #160 - Name Matching with Privacy**
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Enhanced Phase 2  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - CRAN Submission Blocker

**Problem**: Name matching process requires manual intervention when privacy masking is applied. Users need clear guidance for handling unmatched names while maintaining privacy protection.

**Solution**: **Enhanced Phase 2 - Hybrid Documentation + Targeted Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete**: User experience analysis with all 4 scenarios tested
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-First Design**: System correctly stops for unmatched names
- ‚úÖ **User Guidance**: Clear instructions for manual name mapping
- ‚úÖ **Technical Improvements**: Fix warnings, enhance error handling, add validation
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Comprehensive troubleshooting and examples

**Implementation Timeline**: 1 week  
**Documentation**: `ISSUE_160_CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md` (consolidated plan ready)

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- **Core Functionality**: All 42 exported functions implemented and functional
- **Package Structure**: Standard R package layout with proper DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE
- **Test Infrastructure**: 43 test files with excellent coverage of exported functions
- **Documentation**: README.md with comprehensive workflow examples and GitHub Pages vignettes
- **Repository Setup**: Clean main branch, proper git workflow with branch protection
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub issues consolidated and organized with proper labels
- **CRAN Compliance**: License and R-CMD-check issues resolved ([Issue #21](https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement_cursor/issues/21) - CLOSED)
- **Master Audit**: Comprehensive codebase audit completed ([Issue #15](https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement_cursor/issues/15) - CLOSED)
- **Vignettes**: Complete vignette suite created and deployed to GitHub Pages ([Issue #45](https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/45) - CLOSED)
- **Privacy Implementation**: Privacy-first MVP implemented with `ensure_privacy()` and `set_privacy_defaults()` functions
 - **API Consolidation & Privacy Tools**: Unified user-facing APIs with `plot_users()`, `write_metrics()`, and `analyze_transcripts()`; legacy plotting/writing functions now delegate for backward compatibility. Added `privacy_audit()` and provenance attributes on outputs; standardized metric names to `perc_*` with backward-compatible aliases.
 - **CI Enhancements**: Added benchmark workflow with configurable performance budgets; expanded R-CMD-check matrix across OS/R versions.
 - **Traceability Updates**: Filed follow-up issues for hygiene and enforcement: #206 (deprecation badges/timeline), #207 (curate exports), #208 (schema/provenance docs), #209 (benchmark budgets), #210 (edge/error-path tests), #211 (`.Rbuildignore` top-level dirs).
 - **Test Suite**: **1650 tests passing, 0 failures**
 - **R CMD Check**: **0 errors, 0 warnings, 2 notes** (excellent progress!)
 - **Test Coverage**: 90.22% (target achieved)

### Documentation
- **Complete Guide**: `docs/development/CONTEXT_SCRIPTS_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Quick Reference**: `scripts/README.md`

## Pre-CRAN Development Workflow

### Pre-PR Validation (Development Phase)

#### Phase 1: Code Quality (5-10 minutes)
```r
# Ensure consistent code formatting
styler::style_pkg()

# Check code quality (optional - can be overridden for acceptable issues)
lintr::lint_package()
```

#### Phase 2: Documentation (2-5 minutes)
```r
# Update all roxygen2 documentation
devtools::document()

# Rebuild README.md from README.Rmd
devtools::build_readme()

# Check for typos in documentation
devtools::spell_check()
```

#### Phase 3: Testing (3-5 minutes)
```r
# Run all tests
devtools::test()

# Check test coverage (aim for >90%)
covr::package_coverage()
```

#### Phase 4: Final Validation (5-10 minutes)
```r
# Full package check (should be 0 errors, 0 warnings, minimal notes)
devtools::check()

# Create distributable package
devtools::build()
```

#### Phase 5: Bugbot-Style Validation (2-3 minutes)
```r
# Run comprehensive validation similar to Cursor Bugbot
source("scripts/pre-pr-validation.R")
```

**What this catches:**
- Data structure validation (column names, types)
- Function signature verification  
- Vignette build testing
- Documentation completeness
- Code style and quality issues
- Common R package pitfalls

### Real-World Testing (Production Validation)

#### When to Run Real-World Testing
- Before CRAN submission
- When testing with real confidential data
- For performance validation with large datasets
- For privacy and security feature validation

#### Real-World Testing Process
```r
# Set up secure testing environment (outside of LLM environments)
# Copy testing infrastructure to secure location
# Add real confidential data
# Run comprehensive real-world tests
source("scripts/real_world_testing/run_real_world_tests.R")
```

**What this validates:**
- Performance with real Zoom transcripts
- Name matching with actual student rosters
- Privacy features and data anonymization
- Memory usage with large files
- Error handling with real-world edge cases
- Integration testing with confidential data

#### Testing Process Relationship
- **QA Process**: Development-time validation (safe for all environments)
- **Real-World Testing**: Production validation (requires secure environment)
- **Workflow**: QA ‚Üí Real-World Testing ‚Üí CRAN Submission

### PR and Merge Workflow

#### Before Creating PR
1. **Complete all 4 phases** of pre-PR validation above
2. **Ensure all checks pass** locally
3. **Update branch** with latest changes from main

#### PR Creation and Review
1. **Create PR** with descriptive title and description
2. **Link to issues** using `Fixes #X` or `Closes #X`
3. **Request review** from maintainers
4. **Address feedback** and update PR as needed

#### Merge Process
- **Normal merge**: When PR passes all checks and reviews
- **Bypass merge**: When confident in changes and all local checks pass (see bypass guidelines below)

### PR Creation and Merge Process

#### Command-Line PR Creation and Merge
```bash
# 1. Create PR from command line
gh pr create --title "Fix make_template_rmd function" --body "Fixes #X - Rename function and fix template path issues"

# 2. Merge PR with admin override (bypass branch protection)
gh pr merge --auto --delete-branch --admin

# 3. Clean up local branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d bugfix/fix-make-template-rmd-function
```

### Bypassing Branch Protection for Auto-Merge

#### When It's Safe to Bypass
- All local checks pass (`devtools::check()` with 0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Tests pass (`devtools::test()`)
- Code coverage is adequate (>90%)
- Documentation is complete
- No spelling errors

#### GitHub CLI Method
```bash
# Bypass branch protection for auto-merge
gh pr merge --auto --delete-branch --admin
```

#### Admin Override Method
1. Go to PR on GitHub
2. Click "Merge pull request" (admin override option)
3. Select merge strategy
4. Confirm merge

#### Responsible Bypassing
- Only bypass when you're confident in the changes
- Document why bypass was necessary
- Consider adding comments to PR explaining the bypass
- Use bypass sparingly - prefer normal review process when possible

## CRAN Submission Workflow (Future)

*Note: This section is for when the package is ready for CRAN submission. Currently, we're in the pre-CRAN development phase.*

### CRAN Submission Process

#### Step 1: Prepare Submission Files
1. **Create submission tarball:**
   ```r
   devtools::build()
   ```

2. **Verify package structure:**
   - Check that `DESCRIPTION` has correct version, license, and dependencies
   - Ensure `NAMESPACE` is properly generated
   - Verify all documentation files are present

#### Step 2: Submit to CRAN
1. **Go to CRAN submission form:** https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html
2. **Upload package tarball** (`.tar.gz` file from `devtools::build()`)
3. **Fill out submission form:**
   - Package name: `zoomstudentengagement`
   - Version: Current version from `DESCRIPTION`
   - License: MIT
   - Title: "Analyze Student Engagement from Zoom Transcripts"
   - Description: Brief description of package functionality
   - Author: Your name and email
   - Maintainer: Your name and email

#### Step 3: Post-Submission
1. **Monitor CRAN email** for feedback or approval
2. **Address any issues** if CRAN requests changes
3. **Resubmit** if necessary with updated version number
4. **Update repository** with final CRAN version

### Speeding Up R CMD Check

#### Development vs Production Checks
- **`devtools::check()`**: Most conservative, includes all checks (recommended for CRAN)
- **`devtools::check_built()`**: Faster, checks built package
- **`devtools::check_rhub()`**: Test on multiple platforms

#### Parallel Processing
```r
# Use parallel processing for faster checks
devtools::check(parallel = TRUE)

# Specify number of cores
devtools::check(parallel = 4)
```

#### Selective Checking
```r
# Skip specific checks for faster development
devtools::check(
  document = FALSE,  # Skip documentation checks
  manual = FALSE,    # Skip manual generation
  vignettes = FALSE  # Skip vignette building
)
```

### Bypassing Branch Protection for Auto-Merge

#### When It's Safe to Bypass
- All local checks pass (`devtools::check()` with 0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Tests pass (`devtools::test()`)
- Code coverage is adequate (>90%)
- Documentation is complete
- No spelling errors

#### GitHub CLI Method
```bash
# Bypass branch protection for auto-merge
gh pr merge --auto --delete-branch --admin
```

#### Admin Override Method
1. Go to PR on GitHub
2. Click "Merge pull request" (admin override option)
3. Select merge strategy
4. Confirm merge

#### Responsible Bypassing
- Only bypass when you're confident in the changes
- Document why bypass was necessary
- Consider adding comments to PR explaining the bypass
- Use bypass sparingly - prefer normal review process when possible

### Post-CRAN Release

#### Update Repository
1. **Tag the release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Create GitHub release:**
   ```bash
   gh release create v1.0.0 --title "CRAN Release v1.0.0" --notes "Initial CRAN submission"
   ```

3. **Update documentation:**
   - Add CRAN badge to README
   - Update installation instructions
   - Update NEWS.md

#### Monitor and Maintain
1. **Monitor CRAN feedback** for any issues
2. **Address user issues** reported via GitHub
3. **Plan next release** based on feedback and roadmap
4. **Update dependencies** as needed

## Using GitHub Projects/Issues for Tracking Progress

### GitHub Issues
- **Create an Issue:** Go to the "Issues" tab in your repo and click "New issue."
- **Title & Description:** Use clear, descriptive titles. In the description, provide context, steps to reproduce (for bugs), or acceptance criteria (for features).
- **Labels:** Use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`, etc.
- **Assignees & Milestones:** Assign issues to yourself or collaborators, and link them to milestones (e.g., "CRAN Submission").
- **Checklists:** Use markdown checklists for multi-step tasks.

### GitHub Projects (Projects v2)
- [x] Create project board (Projects v2)
- [x] Add initial issues to project board
- [x] Set up columns (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
- [ ] Manual management: Move issues/cards between columns as work progresses
- [ ] Contributors: Update project status manually when working on or closing issues/PRs
- [ ] Set up issue templates for different types of work (bug, enhancement, documentation)
- [ ] Create labels for better issue categorization
- [ ] Set up automation rules for issue/PR status updates
- [ ] Document project board workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Note: Projects v2 does not currently support built-in automation (e.g., auto-move on PR merge/close). Monitor GitHub updates for future automation features.
- Not recommended: Classic Projects (deprecated by GitHub)

### Project Board Workflow
1. **Issue Creation**
   - Use appropriate issue template
   - Add relevant labels
   - Assign to appropriate milestone
   - Add to project board in "To Do" column

2. **Work Progress**
   - Move issue to "In Progress" when starting work
   - Update issue with progress comments
   - Link PRs to issues using "Fixes #X" or "Closes #X"
   - Move to "Review" when PR is ready

3. **Review Process**
   - Reviewers: Check PR against acceptance criteria
   - Move to "Done" after successful review and merge
   - Close related issues automatically via PR merge

4. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Weekly review of project board
   - Update issue priorities
   - Clean up stale issues
   - Update project status in team meetings

### Issue Templates
Create the following issue templates:
- Bug Report
- Feature Request
- Documentation Update
- Test Enhancement
- CRAN Submission Task

### Labels
Set up the following label categories:
- Priority: High, Medium, Low
- Type: Bug, Enhancement, Documentation, Test
- Status: Blocked, In Progress, Needs Review
- Area: Core, UI, Testing, Documentation
- CRAN: Submission, Review, Compliance

### Automation Rules
Set up the following automation rules:
- When PR is opened: Move linked issue to "Review"
- When PR is merged: Move linked issue to "Done"
- When issue is closed: Remove from project board
- When issue is reopened: Add back to "To Do"

### Project Board Metrics
Track the following metrics:
- Issue completion rate
- Average time in each column
- Number of issues per milestone
- Contributor activity
- PR review time

### Workflow Example
1. **Break down your project plan into issues:**  
   - "Refactor function names for clarity"
   - "Add roxygen2 documentation to all exported functions"
   - "Expand test coverage to 90%"
   - "Prepare for CRAN submission"

2. **Assign issues to milestones:**  
   - "CRAN v1.0 Release"

3. **Organize issues in a Project board:**  
   - Move issues from "To Do" to "In Progress" as you work on them, and to "Done" when finished.

4. **Reference issues in commits and pull requests:**  
   - Use `Fixes #12` in a commit or PR description to automatically close the issue when merged.

     - Cache both CRAN and GitHub packages
     - Set appropriate cache keys and paths

  2. **Dependency Management:**
     - Replace manual dependency installation with `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2`
     - Configure to install only necessary dependencies
     - Use `dependencies: c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")` instead of `TRUE`

  3. **System Dependencies:**
     - Cache system package installations
     - Optimize apt-get update/install commands
     - Consider using pre-built Docker images

  4. **Workflow Structure:**
     - Separate dependency installation from testing
     - Use matrix builds for different R versions
     - Implement conditional steps based on changes

  5. **Monitoring:**
     - Add timing information to workflow steps
     - Track cache hit rates
     - Monitor workflow performance metrics

- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Create new branch for workflow optimization
  2. Update R-CMD-check.yaml with optimized configuration
  3. Test workflow performance
  4. Document optimization results
  5. Create pull request with changes

- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Reduced workflow execution time
  - More reliable dependency installation
  - Better resource utilization
  - Improved developer experience

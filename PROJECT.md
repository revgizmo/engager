```

### PR and Merge Workflow

#### Before Creating PR
1. **Complete all 4 phases** of pre-PR validation above
2. **Ensure all checks pass** locally
3. **Update branch** with latest changes from main

#### PR Creation and Review
1. **Create PR** with descriptive title and description
2. **Link to issues** using `Fixes #X` or `Closes #X`
3. **Request review** from maintainers
4. **Address feedback** and update PR as needed

#### Merge Process
- **Normal merge**: When PR passes all checks and reviews
- **Bypass merge**: When confident in changes and all local checks pass (see bypass guidelines below)

### PR Creation and Merge Process

#### Command-Line PR Creation and Merge
```bash
# 1. Create PR from command line
gh pr create --title "Fix make_template_rmd function" --body "Fixes #X - Rename function and fix template path issues"

# 2. Merge PR with admin override (bypass branch protection)
gh pr merge --auto --delete-branch --admin

# 3. Clean up local branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d bugfix/fix-make-template-rmd-function
```

### Bypassing Branch Protection for Auto-Merge

#### When It's Safe to Bypass
- All local checks pass (`devtools::check()` with 0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Tests pass (`devtools::test()`)
- Code coverage is adequate (>90%)
- Documentation is complete
- No spelling errors

#### GitHub CLI Method
```bash
# Bypass branch protection for auto-merge
gh pr merge --auto --delete-branch --admin
```

#### Admin Override Method
1. Go to PR on GitHub
2. Click "Merge pull request" (admin override option)
3. Select merge strategy
4. Confirm merge

#### Responsible Bypassing
- Only bypass when you're confident in the changes
- Document why bypass was necessary
- Consider adding comments to PR explaining the bypass
- Use bypass sparingly - prefer normal review process when possible

## CRAN Submission Workflow (Future)

*Note: This section is for when the package is ready for CRAN submission. Currently, we're in the pre-CRAN development phase.*

### CRAN Submission Process

#### Step 1: Prepare Submission Files
1. **Create submission tarball:**
   ```r
   devtools::build()
   ```

2. **Verify package structure:**
   - Check that `DESCRIPTION` has correct version, license, and dependencies
   - Ensure `NAMESPACE` is properly generated
   - Verify all documentation files are present

#### Step 2: Submit to CRAN
1. **Go to CRAN submission form:** https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html
2. **Upload package tarball** (`.tar.gz` file from `devtools::build()`)
3. **Fill out submission form:**
   - Package name: `zoomstudentengagement`
   - Version: Current version from `DESCRIPTION`
   - License: MIT
   - Title: "Analyze Student Engagement from Zoom Transcripts"
   - Description: Brief description of package functionality
   - Author: Your name and email
   - Maintainer: Your name and email

#### Step 3: Post-Submission
1. **Monitor CRAN email** for feedback or approval
2. **Address any issues** if CRAN requests changes
3. **Resubmit** if necessary with updated version number
4. **Update repository** with final CRAN version

### Speeding Up R CMD Check

#### Development vs Production Checks
- **`devtools::check()`**: Most conservative, includes all checks (recommended for CRAN)
- **`devtools::check_built()`**: Faster, checks built package
- **`devtools::check_rhub()`**: Test on multiple platforms

#### Parallel Processing
```r
# Use parallel processing for faster checks
devtools::check(parallel = TRUE)

# Specify number of cores
devtools::check(parallel = 4)
```

#### Selective Checking
```r
# Skip specific checks for faster development
devtools::check(
  document = FALSE,  # Skip documentation checks
  manual = FALSE,    # Skip manual generation
  vignettes = FALSE  # Skip vignette building
)
```

### Bypassing Branch Protection for Auto-Merge

#### When It's Safe to Bypass
- All local checks pass (`devtools::check()` with 0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Tests pass (`devtools::test()`)
- Code coverage is adequate (>90%)
- Documentation is complete
- No spelling errors

#### GitHub CLI Method
```bash
# Bypass branch protection for auto-merge
gh pr merge --auto --delete-branch --admin
```

#### Admin Override Method
1. Go to PR on GitHub
2. Click "Merge pull request" (admin override option)
3. Select merge strategy
4. Confirm merge

#### Responsible Bypassing
- Only bypass when you're confident in the changes
- Document why bypass was necessary
- Consider adding comments to PR explaining the bypass
- Use bypass sparingly - prefer normal review process when possible

### Post-CRAN Release

#### Update Repository
1. **Tag the release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Create GitHub release:**

## Using GitHub Projects/Issues for Tracking Progress

### GitHub Issues
- **Create an Issue:** Go to the "Issues" tab in your repo and click "New issue."
- **Title & Description:** Use clear, descriptive titles. In the description, provide context, steps to reproduce (for bugs), or acceptance criteria (for features).
- **Labels:** Use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`, etc.
- **Assignees & Milestones:** Assign issues to yourself or collaborators, and link them to milestones (e.g., "CRAN Submission").
- **Checklists:** Use markdown checklists for multi-step tasks.

### GitHub Projects (Projects v2)
- [x] Create project board (Projects v2)
- [x] Add initial issues to project board
- [x] Set up columns (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
- [ ] Manual management: Move issues/cards between columns as work progresses
- [ ] Contributors: Update project status manually when working on or closing issues/PRs
- [ ] Set up issue templates for different types of work (bug, enhancement, documentation)
- [ ] Create labels for better issue categorization
- [ ] Set up automation rules for issue/PR status updates
- [ ] Document project board workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Note: Projects v2 does not currently support built-in automation (e.g., auto-move on PR merge/close). Monitor GitHub updates for future automation features.
- Not recommended: Classic Projects (deprecated by GitHub)

### Project Board Workflow
1. **Issue Creation**
   - Use appropriate issue template
   - Add relevant labels
   - Assign to appropriate milestone
   - Add to project board in "To Do" column

2. **Work Progress**
   - Move issue to "In Progress" when starting work
   - Update issue with progress comments
   - Link PRs to issues using "Fixes #X" or "Closes #X"
   - Move to "Review" when PR is ready

3. **Review Process**
   - Reviewers: Check PR against acceptance criteria
   - Move to "Done" after successful review and merge
   - Close related issues automatically via PR merge

4. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Weekly review of project board
   - Update issue priorities
   - Clean up stale issues
   - Update project status in team meetings

### Issue Templates
Create the following issue templates:
- Bug Report
- Feature Request
- Documentation Update
- Test Enhancement
- CRAN Submission Task

### Labels
Set up the following label categories:
- Priority: High, Medium, Low
- Type: Bug, Enhancement, Documentation, Test
- Status: Blocked, In Progress, Needs Review
- Area: Core, UI, Testing, Documentation
- CRAN: Submission, Review, Compliance

### Automation Rules
Set up the following automation rules:
- When PR is opened: Move linked issue to "Review"
- When PR is merged: Move linked issue to "Done"
- When issue is closed: Remove from project board
- When issue is reopened: Add back to "To Do"

### Project Board Metrics
Track the following metrics:
- Issue completion rate
- Average time in each column
- Number of issues per milestone
- Contributor activity
- PR review time

### Workflow Example
1. **Break down your project plan into issues:**  
   - "Refactor function names for clarity"
   - "Add roxygen2 documentation to all exported functions"
   - "Expand test coverage to 90%"
   - "Prepare for CRAN submission"

2. **Assign issues to milestones:**  
   - "CRAN v1.0 Release"

3. **Organize issues in a Project board:**  
   - Move issues from "To Do" to "In Progress" as you work on them, and to "Done" when finished.

4. **Reference issues in commits and pull requests:**  
   - Use `Fixes #12` in a commit or PR description to automatically close the issue when merged.

  - [x] Initial workflow setup with R-CMD-check.yaml
  - [ ] Optimize dependency installation:
    - [ ] Add R package caching using `actions/cache`
    - [ ] Use `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2` for efficient dependency management
    - [ ] Configure dependency installation to only install necessary packages
    - [ ] Add caching for system dependencies
  - [ ] Monitor and optimize workflow performance:
    - [ ] Track installation times
    - [ ] Identify bottlenecks
    - [ ] Document optimization strategies
- **Stage 2:** Add code coverage reporting (covr)
- **Stage 3:** Add code style/linting checks (lintr)
- **Stage 4:** Add automated documentation builds (pkgdown)
- **Stage 5:** Expand to multiple OSes (macOS, Windows) and R versions as needed

### GitHub Actions Optimization
- **Current Issues:**
  - Long dependency installation times (7+ minutes)
  - Inefficient package caching
  - Redundant dependency installations

- **Optimization Strategy:**
  1. **Package Caching:**
     - Implement R package caching using `actions/cache`
     - Cache both CRAN and GitHub packages
     - Set appropriate cache keys and paths

  2. **Dependency Management:**
     - Replace manual dependency installation with `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2`
     - Configure to install only necessary dependencies
     - Use `dependencies: c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")` instead of `TRUE`

  3. **System Dependencies:**
     - Cache system package installations
     - Optimize apt-get update/install commands
     - Consider using pre-built Docker images

  4. **Workflow Structure:**
     - Separate dependency installation from testing
     - Use matrix builds for different R versions
     - Implement conditional steps based on changes

  5. **Monitoring:**
     - Add timing information to workflow steps
     - Track cache hit rates
     - Monitor workflow performance metrics

- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Create new branch for workflow optimization
  2. Update R-CMD-check.yaml with optimized configuration
  3. Test workflow performance
  4. Document optimization results
  5. Create pull request with changes

- **Expected Benefits:**
  - Reduced workflow execution time
  - More reliable dependency installation
  - Better resource utilization
  - Improved developer experience

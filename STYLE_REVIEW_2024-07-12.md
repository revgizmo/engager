# Style Review: styler::style_pkg() (2024-07-12)

## Purpose
This branch applies automatic code formatting to all R and test files using `styler::style_pkg()` on 2024-07-12. The goal is to ensure consistent code style and formatting across the codebase, improving readability and maintainability.

## What Was Changed
- All R scripts and test files were reformatted according to the tidyverse style guide.
- No functional or logic changes were madeâ€”only whitespace, indentation, and line breaks were affected.
- `README.md` was re-knitted from `README.Rmd` to ensure it is up to date.

## How to Review
1. **Check the diff for functional changes:**
   - There should be no changes to code logic, only formatting.
2. **Look for accidental edits:**
   - Confirm that only style/formatting was changed.
3. **Test the package:**
   - Run `devtools::check()` and `devtools::test()` to ensure all tests still pass.
4. **If everything looks good:**
   - Approve and merge the branch.

## Next Steps
- After review, merge this branch into `main` to standardize code style.
- Delete the branch after merging to keep the repository clean.

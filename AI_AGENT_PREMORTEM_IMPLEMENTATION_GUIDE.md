# AI Agent Premortem Analysis - Implementation Guide

**Mission**: Create comprehensive premortem analysis for AI agent workflows using Gary Klein's premortem technique

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

### **Step 1: Environment Assessment and Setup**

```bash
# 1.1 Verify project context
ls -la DESCRIPTION NAMESPACE
echo "Project Type: R Package (CRAN target)"

# 1.2 Check existing AI agent documentation
ls -la docs/development/AI_AGENT_*.md

# 1.3 Review current project status
cat PROJECT.md | head -20
```

### **Step 2: Risk Identification Phase**

#### **2.1 Analyze Existing AI Agent Workflows**
```bash
# Read and analyze existing AI agent documents
cat docs/development/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md
cat docs/development/AI_AGENT_TRAINING.md
cat docs/development/AI_AGENT_EXAMPLES.md
cat docs/development/AI_AGENT_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md
```

#### **2.2 Review Project History for AI Agent Issues**
```bash
# Search for AI agent related issues in git history
git log --grep="AI agent" --oneline
git log --grep="agent" --oneline | head -10

# Check for any AI agent related problems in issues
gh issue list --search="AI agent" --state=all
```

#### **2.3 Identify Critical Dependencies**
- **Code Quality**: Linting, testing, documentation standards
- **Integration Points**: Git workflow, PR process, CI/CD
- **Project Standards**: CRAN compliance, privacy requirements
- **Human Oversight**: Review processes, quality gates

### **Step 3: Premortem Exercise Execution**

#### **3.1 Imagine Catastrophic Failure**
**Scenario**: "It's 6 months from now. The AI agent workflow has completely failed. The project is in disarray. What went wrong?"

**Key Questions to Answer**:
1. What specific failures occurred?
2. When did things start going wrong?
3. Who or what was responsible?
4. What were the warning signs?
5. How did the failures cascade?

#### **3.2 Document Failure Scenarios**

**Create detailed failure scenarios for each category**:

**Technical Failures**:
- AI agents introduced bugs that broke existing functionality
- Code quality degraded over time due to inconsistent standards
- Performance issues from poorly optimized AI-generated code
- Integration conflicts between AI agent work and human contributions

**Process Failures**:
- AI agents bypassed review processes
- Documentation became inconsistent or outdated
- Training materials became obsolete
- Workflow processes broke down under scale

**Project Failures**:
- CRAN submission delayed due to AI agent issues
- Quality standards compromised
- Privacy violations introduced
- Project reputation damaged

**Ethical Failures**:
- Inappropriate automation of sensitive tasks
- Bias introduced in student engagement analysis
- Privacy violations in transcript processing
- Misuse of AI capabilities for surveillance

### **Step 4: Root Cause Analysis**

#### **4.1 For Each Failure Scenario, Identify**:
- **Immediate Causes**: What directly caused the failure?
- **Contributing Factors**: What made the failure more likely?
- **Root Causes**: What underlying issues enabled the failure?
- **Systemic Issues**: What organizational or process problems existed?

#### **4.2 Use 5-Why Analysis**
For each major failure, ask "Why?" five times to reach root causes.

**Example**:
1. Why did the AI agent introduce a critical bug? â†’ Didn't follow testing protocols
2. Why didn't it follow testing protocols? â†’ Testing requirements weren't clear
3. Why weren't testing requirements clear? â†’ Documentation was outdated
4. Why was documentation outdated? â†’ No process for keeping it current
5. Why was there no process? â†’ No ownership assigned for documentation maintenance

### **Step 5: Prevention Strategy Development**

#### **5.1 Create Prevention Measures**
For each root cause identified, develop specific prevention strategies:

**Process Improvements**:
- Mandatory code review for all AI agent contributions
- Automated quality gates in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular documentation audits and updates
- Clear escalation procedures for quality issues

**Technical Safeguards**:
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements
- Automated linting and style checking
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring
- Privacy compliance validation

**Training and Documentation**:
- Regular AI agent training updates
- Clear workflow documentation
- Best practices guides
- Troubleshooting procedures

#### **5.2 Design Monitoring Systems**
- **Early Warning Indicators**: Metrics that signal potential problems
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks that must pass
- **Human Oversight**: Review processes and approval requirements
- **Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms for continuous improvement

### **Step 6: Document Creation**

#### **6.1 Create AI_AGENT_PREMORTEM.md**
```markdown

```

#### **6.2 Integration with Existing Documentation**
- Update `AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` with risk awareness
- Add risk considerations to `AI_AGENT_TRAINING.md`
- Include risk examples in `AI_AGENT_EXAMPLES.md`
- Update `AI_AGENT_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md` with risk validation

### **Step 7: Validation and Testing**

#### **7.1 Review with Project Context**
```bash
# Ensure alignment with project goals
cat PROJECT.md | grep -i "cran\|quality\|privacy"

# Check integration with existing processes
cat CONTRIBUTING.md | grep -i "ai\|agent"
```

#### **7.2 Validate Completeness**

find docs/development -name "AI_AGENT_*.md" -exec wc -l {} \;

# Check project status and context
cat PROJECT.md | grep -A 5 -B 5 "CRAN\|quality\|risk"

# Review recent AI agent related changes
git log --since="3 months ago" --grep="AI\|agent" --oneline

# Update existing documentation
# (Edit files as needed based on integration requirements)
```

## ðŸ“Š **Timeline and Milestones**

- **Hour 1-2**: Risk identification and scenario development
- **Hour 3-4**: Root cause analysis and 5-why exercises  
- **Hour 5-6**: Prevention strategy development
- **Hour 7-8**: Document creation and integration
- **Hour 9**: Validation and final review

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Success Factors**

1. **Thoroughness**: Don't rush the risk identification phase
2. **Specificity**: Avoid generic risks; focus on project-specific issues
3. **Actionability**: Every prevention strategy must be implementable
4. **Integration**: Ensure seamless integration with existing workflows
5. **Validation**: Test all recommendations against project context

#' Create Metrics Lookup Data Frame
#'
#' Creates a tibble describing all engagement metrics used in the analysis.
#' This function returns a comprehensive lookup table with metric labels and their
#' descriptions, which are used throughout the package for reporting, plotting,
#' and documentation purposes.
#'
#' @return A tibble with two columns containing metric definitions:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{metric}{Character. The metric label used in the package (e.g., "session_ct", "duration")}
#'     \item{description}{Character. A human-readable description of what the metric measures}
#'   }
#'
#' The following metrics are included:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{session_ct}: Number of sessions in which Zoom captured a verbal comment
#'   \item \code{n}: Number of separate verbal comments captured by Zoom
#'   \item \code{perc_n}: Percent of separate verbal comments captured by Zoom, across all students
#'   \item \code{duration}: Total duration in minutes of verbal comments captured by Zoom
#'   \item \code{perc_duration}: Percent of total duration of verbal comments captured by Zoom
#'   \item \code{wordcount}: Total word count of verbal comments captured by Zoom
#'   \item \code{perc_wordcount}: Percent of total word count of verbal comments captured by Zoom
#'   \item \code{wpm}: Average words per minute within verbal comments captured by Zoom

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Merge Ready Branches**: Several branches appear ready for merge (issue-488, issue-394)
2. **Clean Up Stale Branches**: Remove empty branches (issue-153, issue-455-456)
3. **Consolidate Rename Work**: Merge the two identical rename branches

### Strategic Considerations
1. **Package Rename**: Complete the engager package rename initiative

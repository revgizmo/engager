**This document guides AI agents to create comprehensive PR review prompts for evaluating and merging pull requests.**

## üéØ **Instructions for AI Agent**

When a user asks: **"Please make me a prompt for reviewing PR [NUMBER] with @PR_REVIEW_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md"**

**Complete these steps automatically:**

### **Step 1: Analyze PR Details**

1. **Fetch PR Information**: Use `gh pr view [NUMBER]` to get comprehensive details
2. **Analyze Changes**: Review file changes, additions, deletions, and scope
3. **Check Context**: Identify linked issues, related work, and dependencies
4. **Assess Impact**: Determine if changes are user-facing, internal, or infrastructure

### **Step 2: Create Review Assessment**

1. **Create Review Summary**: `PR_[NUMBER]_REVIEW_ASSESSMENT.md`
   - Document PR scope and key changes
   - Identify potential risks and benefits
   - Assess alignment with project goals
   - Note any blocking issues or dependencies

2. **Create Merge Decision Guide**: `PR_[NUMBER]_MERGE_DECISION.md`

   - Include pre-merge validation steps
   - Define post-merge verification requirements
   - Specify rollback procedures if needed

### **Step 3: Generate Short Copyable Message**

Create a concise message for the PR review AI agent following this format:

```

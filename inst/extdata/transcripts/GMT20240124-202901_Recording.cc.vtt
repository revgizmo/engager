WEBVTT

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This doesn't.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This as a nerd, it's the window that we use to write our code.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Yeah.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And I actually really like this format that our studio has for doing that. So this is the text document.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You're an honest team.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yep. Okay.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.000
That has the basics telling us that this is the Zoom student engagement analysis and when I hit the button it will spit out an HTML file.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Yeah.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
How Yes.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Okay.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And then this is the code that I can run on the computer to do this. So I'm telling it to load a bunch of libraries, for example.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And then these are the steps. Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And then these are the steps. Consistent with this outline here of the steps that I can. I organized my code and tell myself what to do.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I don't expect anything.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
No, I don't expect anybody to follow the code part of this, but this is where I read in.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The file and then do things with it to turn the transcript into data.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Okay.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Thank you.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And then I have more, but the basic idea of what I'm doing. Is I start that everything I did above is the formula and the code function that I wrote to be able to do this analysis.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In. Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So here is where I'm actually doing something I would ask somebody else to do, which is. How many weeks is your class?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
How, you know, how long or what time of the day is your class. Have them fill it in and then this spits me out a list of all 14 weeks.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
With a start time and end time in GMT.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And then I say this is the LTF, 2324 class term. And then I load some stuff.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I set up a class roster and I load that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And now I have a list of students. What I'll have after this is I'm going to see Dr.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Melissa Coe, Shihar Shujani in the transcript file. And I'll be able to organize it for the actual people in the class.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And then I can go to zoom. And this is anybody who's using them can go to Zoom, go to the cloud recordings.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Copy a CSV file that tells us which recordings the Download the transcripts themselves that are just text file, but they come with a dot VTT format.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And all you're doing is going and clicking on it saying, yeah, I want to download that one, download that.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And then I load all that stuff in automatically. So. When I'm pulling this stuff down, I don't have to know the name of the course.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I don't need to know any of when the sessions were. I just need to go grab the files and toss them in the folder and this will load them automatically.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And what it saw was there are 2 files in there for 2 different course sessions. These are just examples that I loaded it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And I'm able to process it. In this little example, I'm doing lots of talking, but what questions to people at?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It was completely lost.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I have a question. What does the output look like? Like what it actually, are you able to show us like an example?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Transfer.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I absolutely will do that. So looking through really quickly, I, I do the couple of extra steps just to kind of get the, the data dump of steps.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
If I cancel a class, I'm expecting not to have a recording. I have a file where I load that.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And then I end up with a file that I then once it now that I have my classes and my transcripts, this is the step where actually do the transcription and analysis.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So I went from having one row. To having 13 rows, one for each person who talked.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Me and each of the students. And this is the number of times they talked. Ryan, what do you got?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Yeah, I think, it's so interesting. One thing that I'm wondering is for people who are less, let's say tech savvy than you are.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm sure there will be some rootinizing of these things as you share the tool, for other people.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It looks like a number of steps for populating the data need to be done currently by the user.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It looks like a number of steps, for populating the data need to be done currently by the user and I wonder Do you anticipate ways to sort of, I don't know, rootinize that or make it sort of an automatic sort of process or.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
You know the lowest pain point possible for instructors

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Who answers? Yes, I very much intend to automate it or routinize it. I like the way that you're framing that.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Say here are the steps and just have that be, you know, step one. Load your file, step 2, do this, tell me what the term is, whatever the steps are, and have that be a standardized process.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:10.000
That has a much friendlier user interface. And part of today is getting some feedback about where to draw that line or what it is that would help clarify.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Which is why I'm diving into the deep end with some intention now. Because if it isn't clear now and it is clear later, that's a helpful.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Traditional.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And if it's not clear later, that helps me calibrate a lot.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So what I end up with. Go on. Yeah, sure.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:46.000
How sensitive. Oh, how sensitive is your analysis to the noisiness of the transcript. So if it's a noisy call and the transcript is, You know, Zoom can have.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The performance of the Zoom transcript can depend on the qualities of the call.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So right now I started talking and I started talking right there a little early with intention because the green box is my experience what zoom is going to do.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It's gonna take the sound that it hears and transcribe those words and assign them to the person who is in the green box.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
When you were talking at the at first, you were talking everything that it transcribed from the voice stream.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Goes to you and I started interjecting at first it didn't take it so my words will be assigned to you.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And then about halfway through when I started talking and you were. I watched the green box move to me.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So some of the stuff you were saying is the time to me. Which is a big challenge for me when doing when I have students who interject with small insightful thoughts occasionally.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
In the middle of a long run on thought from my talkative student. Because the green box never moves.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
To the other person. And how much of a problem that is, is one of the things I'm struggling.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I had one thing to clarify, Connor. So is it participation in your class only when someone on mutes and talks or is is a chat comments question also counted as participation.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Right now I use a pretty holistic definition of participation. The rubric is very light in what we're saying.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Meaningfully contributing throughout the semester. It's about as precise as again. So that's one of my big tension points is I have breakout sessions that last half an hour or more of the 90Â min class and those aren't recorded.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Hmm.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Only the group up time is recorded. And so how much can I use this? I feel like I can use this as concrete feedback about what it's capturing.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:46.000
No, that I have this green box problem of who's talking. But how much can I get use that with the qualitative other thoughts that I have and not negatively impact student participation and experience.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Because they talk in breakout. And then don't talk much in the big group. So they're hugely impacting the overall class experience.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
They don't get points in this amount.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I have a follow-up when they do the breakout rooms to you kind of pop in and out of the rooms to see if everyone is more, well you can't tell because they might be talking just because you're there but do you happen to pop it out or is it mostly on a trust basis?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Throughout the semester I pop in and out mostly for the logistical like I just want to make sure everything's working here nobody's having a problem that gives me the convenience of my random pop in somebody's talking.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000
At some point is everybody talking. At least do they seem attentive in that and they so I have a qualitative element of it, but I don't track that.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Okay, thank you. Can I say something before about I'm sorry. I was gonna say, I think we could probably even keep talking about it.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Huh.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:00.000
It's, yeah, there's a lot to go off of there. But to go back to the greenbox problem, something that occurs to me would be to just ask real fast. To go back to the green box problem, something that occurs to me would be to just ask real fast. Can you repeat that?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I like that. Thank you.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Yeah.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Yeah, this is where I need to deal with the multiple screens issue that I have because I need to write stuff down.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000
That the last couple of thoughts and then I could bring everybody back and we can talk about stuff. Well, one of the challenges of L is people can change their name.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And I haven't run into name collision. Where somebody changes their name.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
What happens if I do this? Well, I have a he him issue, but I'm sitting here.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I've become Ryan. But I do have things where people go by different names or they're logged in on computers that don't have that.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And this step is integral to it to being able to do that where I have their zoom name in their formal name and I can match them up which allows me to tie it back to the student within the roster and more importantly, duke them across class sessions.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000
If their name changes, I wanna make sure that Ryan is Ryan throughout.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So ultimately I get a summary and I can start doing analytics like having charts of who participated in who didn't.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And final reports. But, are there any questions about this? Data nerdy stuff. Cool.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Then why don't we come back in for the. Yes, please.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:32.000
One question, one question. What happens when breakout rooms? How would does this work for breakout rooms or just for the main room?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Only the main room.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Okay.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Which is a huge limitation and it's a question of. I can get value on it, but what anybody else or is it like is it?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Insufficient to meet that need is a big question.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Yes.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Can those in the call here? Okay, then why don't we just in into that as a conversation and I'll go ahead and stop the Zoom Meeting and everybody can come join.

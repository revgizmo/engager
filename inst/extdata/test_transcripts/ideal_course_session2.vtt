00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
<v Professor Ed>Welcome back to session two.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Professor Ed>Today we'll explore roster customization.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Tom Miller>I added our roster from CSV.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
<v Tom Miller>It was straightforward.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Samantha Smith>I'm still figuring out preferred names.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Sam Smith (she/her)>I updated my display name, hope that's okay.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Rob Jones>I appreciate the name matching features.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Jose Alvarez>Do we log attendance automatically?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.500
<v A.J. Lopez>Yes, and privacy filters too.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Guest Librarian Grace>I can help with citation tracking.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Guest Mentor Hank>And I'll assist with analytics.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Professor Ed>Thanks, guests.

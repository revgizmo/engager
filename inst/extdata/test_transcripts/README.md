## Usage Guidelines

### For Package Development
1. Use these transcripts to test new features and functions
2. Verify that engagement metrics work across different course types
3. Test multi-session analysis capabilities
4. Validate privacy and anonymization features

### For Documentation Examples
1. Include realistic examples in package documentation
2. Demonstrate various use cases and scenarios
3. Show different course types and engagement patterns
4. Provide examples for vignettes and tutorials

### For Quality Assurance
1. Test edge cases and error handling
2. Verify consistent results across different transcript formats
3. Validate engagement metrics accuracy
4. Test performance with realistic data sizes

## Data Privacy Considerations

These transcripts contain:
- **Fictional names** for all participants
- **Educational content only** - no personal information
- **Realistic but anonymized** interactions
- **No identifying details** about institutions or individuals

The transcripts are designed to be:
- **Safe for testing** without privacy concerns
- **Representative** of real educational scenarios
- **Diverse** in content and participation patterns
- **Suitable** for public package examples

## Contributing New Transcripts

When adding new test transcripts:
1. Use fictional names and scenarios
2. Include realistic educational content
3. Maintain consistent formatting (VTT format)
4. Add appropriate documentation
5. Consider different course types and engagement patterns
6. Ensure privacy and anonymity

## File Format Specifications

All transcripts follow the WebVTT format:
```
WEBVTT

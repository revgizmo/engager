\usage{
consolidate_transcript(df = NULL, max_pause_sec = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble containing the comments from a Zoom recording transcript.}

\item{max_pause_sec}{Maximum pause between comments to be consolidated.  If
the raw comments from the Zoom recording transcript contain 2 consecutive
comments from the same speaker, and the time between the end of the first
comment and start of the second comment is less than \code{max_pause_sec}
seconds, then the comments will be consolidated.  If the time between the
comments is larger, they will not be consolidated. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing consolidated comments from a Zoom recording
transcript.
}
\description{
Take a tibble containing the comments from a Zoom recording transcript and return a tibble
that consolidates all consecutive comments from the same speaker where the time between the
end of the first comment and start of the second comment is less than \code{max_pause_sec} seconds.
This function addresses an issue with the Zoom transcript where the speaker is speaking a
continuous sentence, but the Zoom transcript will cut the comment into two lines.
For example, a comment of "This should be a single sentence." is often split into
"This should be" and "a single sentence". This function stitches those together into
"This should be a single sentence." where the \code{start} time of the consolidated comment
will be the beginning of the first row and the \code{end} time of the consolidated comment
will be the ending of the last row.

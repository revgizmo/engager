\description{
This function takes a tibble containing session details and summary metrics
by speaker for all class sessions (and placeholders for missing sections),
including customized student names (\code{clean_names_df}) and saves a subset as a
csv file with the specified file name (\code{section_names_lookup_file}) to the
specified data folder (\code{data_folder}).

Zoom transcript data that users provide.

\details{
The engager package is designed to work with user-provided data rather than including static datasets.
This approach ensures privacy and allows the package to be used with any institutional data without concerns about
data sharing or licensing.

This package works with user-provided Zoom transcripts and related
institutional data. No static datasets are included with the package.
Typical workflows involve loading transcripts, analyzing engagement,
and exporting metrics. See function help pages for runnable examples.

See also: load_zoom_transcript() for loading transcript data and
write_metrics() for exporting analysis results.

This package works with user-provided data and includes no static datasets.

\arguments{
\item{data_folder}{overall data folder for your recordings. Defaults to
'data'}

\item{section_names_lookup_file}{File name of the csv file of customized
student names by section Defaults to 'section_names_lookup.csv'}

\description{
This function creates a tibble containing session details and summary metrics
by speaker for all class sessions (and placeholders for missing sections)
from the joining of:
\itemize{
\item a tibble of customized student names by section (\code{section_names_lookup_file} in the \code{data_folder} folder),
\item a tibble containing session details and summary metrics by speaker for all class sessions
(\code{transcripts_metrics_df}), and
\item a tibble listing the students enrolled in the class or classes, with rows for each recorded class section for each
student (\code{roster_sessions}) into a single tibble.

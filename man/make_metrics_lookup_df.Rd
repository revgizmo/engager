\title{Create Metrics Lookup Data Frame}
\usage{
make_metrics_lookup_df()
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns containing metric definitions:
\describe{
\item{metric}{Character. The metric label used in the package (e.g., "session_ct", "duration")}
\item{description}{Character. A human-readable description of what the metric measures}
}

The following metrics are included:
\itemize{
\item \code{session_ct}: Number of sessions in which Zoom captured a verbal comment
\item \code{n}: Number of separate verbal comments captured by Zoom
\item \code{perc_n}: Percent of separate verbal comments captured by Zoom, across all students
\item \code{duration}: Total duration in minutes of verbal comments captured by Zoom
\item \code{perc_duration}: Percent of total duration of verbal comments captured by Zoom
\item \code{wordcount}: Total word count of verbal comments captured by Zoom
\item \code{perc_wordcount}: Percent of total word count of verbal comments captured by Zoom
\item \code{wpm}: Average words per minute within verbal comments captured by Zoom
}
}
\description{
Creates a tibble describing all engagement metrics used in the analysis.
This function returns a comprehensive lookup table with metric labels and their
descriptions, which are used throughout the package for reporting, plotting,
and documentation purposes.
}
\examples{
# Get the metrics lookup table
metrics_lookup <- make_metrics_lookup_df()
print(metrics_lookup)

# Use in plotting functions
sample <- tibble::tibble(
  section = c("A", "A"),
  preferred_name = c("Alice", "Bob"),
  session_ct = c(3, 5)
)
plot_users_by_metric(sample, metric = "session_ct", metrics_lookup_df = metrics_lookup)

}

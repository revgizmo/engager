conditionally_write_lookup(df, path, allow_write = FALSE)
}

\item{df}{Data frame. Lookup to write (normalized internally).}

\item{path}{Character. Target CSV path.}

\item{allow_write}{Logical. Default \code{FALSE} (read-only).}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether a write occurred.
}

FALSE, performs no side effects and returns \code{FALSE}.

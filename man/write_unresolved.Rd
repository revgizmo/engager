write_unresolved(unresolved_tbl, path, include_raw = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{unresolved_tbl}{Tibble returned by \code{detect_unmatched_names()}.}

\item{path}{Output file path.}

\item{include_raw}{Logical; include raw names if \code{TRUE} and allowed.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical; overwrite existing file if \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
By default, writes only hashed columns (no raw names). To include raw
names, both conditions must be met: \code{include_raw = TRUE} and
\code{options(engager.allow_raw_name_exports = TRUE)} is set. Otherwise, the
function aborts with class \code{engager_privacy_error}.

\usage{
load_zoom_recorded_sessions_list(
  data_folder = ".",
  transcripts_folder = "transcripts",
  topic_split_pattern = paste0("^(?<dept>\\\\S+) (?<course_section>\\\\S+) - ",
    "(?<day>[A-Za-z]+) (?<time>\\\\S+\\\\s*\\\\S+) (?<instructor>\\\\(.*?\\\\))"),

    "File Count", "Total Views", "Total Downloads", "Last Accessed", sep = ","),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_folder}{overall data folder for your recordings}

\item{transcripts_folder}{specific subfolder of the data folder where you
will store the cloud recording csvs}

\item{topic_split_pattern}{REGEX pattern used to parse the \code{Topic} from the
csvs and extract useful columns. Defaults to
\code{paste0("^(?<dept>\\\\\\\\S+) (?<course_section>\\\\\\\\S+) - ", "(?<day>[A-Za-z]+) (?<time>\\\\\\\\S+\\\\\\\\s*\\\\\\\\S+) (?<instructor>\\\\\\\\(.*?\\\\\\\\))")}
(Note: this REGEX pattern is formatted here as paste0() rather than a
single string to stay beneath the 90 character line limit in the code
checker. A single string works just as well as this combined one). Note:
The function now uses a generalized pattern that can handle various course
naming conventions including \verb{DATASCI 201.006}, \verb{LTF 101}, and
\verb{MATH 250.001} formats.}

\item{zmrcrddsssnscsvnmspttrn}{REGEX pattern used to parse
the csv file names from the cloud recording csvs and extract useful
columns. Defaults to
\verb{zoomus_recordings__\\\\\\\\d\{8\}(?:\\\\\\\\s+copy\\\\\\\\s*\\\\\\\\d*)?\\\\\\\\.csv}}

\item{zmrcrddsssnscsvclnms}{Comma separated string of column
names in the cloud recording csvs. Zoom tends to save the file with an
extra \verb{,} at the end of the header row, causing a null column to be
imported. Defaults to
\verb{Topic,ID,Start Time,File Size (MB),File Count,Total Views,Total Downloads,Last Accessed}}

\item{dept}{the school department associated with the recordings to keep.
Zoom often captures unwanted recordings, and this is used to filter only
the targeted ones. This value is compared to the \code{dept} column extracted
from the \code{Topic} column extracted from cloud recording csvs. Defaults to
\code{LTF}}

\item{semester_start_mdy}{date of the first class in the semester. Defaults
to \verb{Jan 01, 2024}}

\item{scheduled_session_length_hours}{scheduled length of each class session
in hours. Defaults to \code{1.5}}

\item{verbose}{Logical flag to enable diagnostic output. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A tibble listing the session recordings loaded from the cloud
recording csvs. Returns \code{NULL} if the transcripts folder doesn't exist,
or an empty tibble with the correct column structure if no matching
files are found.
}
\description{
This function creates a tibble from a provided csv file of Zoom recordings.
}
\details{
\subsection{Download Zoom csv file with list of recordings and transcripts}{
\enumerate{
\item Go to \url{https://www.zoom.us/recording}
\item Export the Cloud Recordings
\item Copy the cloud recording csv (naming convention:
\verb{zoomus_recordings__\\\\d\{8\}\\.csv}) to \verb{data/transcripts/}
(or whatever path you identify in the \code{data_folder} and
\code{transcripts_folder} parameters).
}
}
}
\note{
The function handles several legacy and edge cases:
\itemize{
\item Trailing commas in CSV headers (common in Zoom exports)
\item Multiple recordings of the same session (takes the most recent)
\item Timezone handling for session start/end times
\item Department filtering for targeted recordings
\item Date format variations in Zoom exports
}
}
\examples{
# Show what happens when no data files exist (returns empty tibble)
load_zoom_recorded_sessions_list(
  data_folder = "nonexistent_folder",
  transcripts_folder = "transcripts"

\dontrun{
# Load actual Zoom recordings data (requires data files)
# Requires a Zoom cloud recordings CSV in the appropriate folder, e.g.:
# inst/extdata/transcripts/zoomus_recordings__20240124.csv

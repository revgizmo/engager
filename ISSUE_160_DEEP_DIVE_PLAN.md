## ‚úÖ **Proposed Approach: Update Existing Infrastructure**

### **Phase 1: User Experience Analysis** (75 minutes) - **IMPLEMENT FIRST**
1. **Walk through the 4 scenarios** in current workflow
2. **Document actual pain points** for each scenario
3. **Identify where users get stuck** in the current process
4. **Plan adjustments** to remaining phases based on findings

### **Phase 2: Edge Case Validation** (30 minutes) - **ADJUST AFTER PHASE 1**
1. **Test specific cases** for each of the 4 name matching scenarios using existing infrastructure
2. **Validate privacy compliance** across all privacy levels for each scenario
3. **Check error handling** for common user mistakes in name matching
4. **Use existing test framework**, not create new ones
5. **CRITICAL**: Test specific name matching scenarios (adjust based on Phase 1 findings):
   - **Scenario 1**: "Guest User" in transcript, not in roster
   - **Scenario 2**: "John Smith" in roster, "JS" in transcript  
   - **Scenario 3**: Student present in session 1, missing in session 2
   - **Scenario 4**: "Dr. Healy" in session 1, "Conor Healy" in session 2
6. **CRITICAL**: Include international names, titles, and error scenarios from Phase 1

### **Phase 3: Documentation Updates** (45 minutes) - **ADJUST AFTER PHASE 1**
1. **Add troubleshooting section** to `whole_game_real_world.Rmd` with code examples
2. **Create step-by-step guides** for resolving each of the 4 name matching scenarios
3. **Provide practical code snippets** for common name matching tasks
4. **Focus on actionable solutions**, not comprehensive documentation
5. **CRITICAL**: Add specific troubleshooting for each scenario (adjust based on Phase 1 findings):
   - **Scenario 1**: How to identify and handle guest users
   - **Scenario 2**: How to match custom names to roster names
   - **Scenario 3**: How to handle missing students across sessions
   - **Scenario 4**: How to link name variations across sessions

## üîç **Name Matching Scenarios Analysis**

Based on your feedback, the following scenarios are the most confusing aspects of the current workflow:

### **Scenario 1: Unmatched Transcript Names**
- **Problem**: Names appear in transcripts that don't match roster or instructors
- **Causes**: Guests, students using custom names, instructors with variations
- **Impact**: Creates confusion about who participated
- **Solution Needed**: Clear guidance for identifying and handling unmatched names

### **Scenario 2: Missing Roster Students**
- **Problem**: Students in roster don't match to names in transcript
- **Causes**: Students using custom names, students who didn't attend
- **Impact**: Missing participation data for enrolled students
- **Solution Needed**: Process for identifying no-shows vs. custom names

### **Scenario 3: Partial Attendance**
- **Problem**: Students who missed some classes
- **Causes**: Absences, technical issues, late arrivals
- **Impact**: Incomplete participation tracking
- **Solution Needed**: Handling missing data across sessions

### **Scenario 4: Name Changes**
- **Problem**: Participants change transcript names within/between sessions
- **Causes**: Zoom settings, user preferences, technical issues
- **Impact**: Inconsistent tracking across sessions
- **Solution Needed**: Process for linking name variations

### **Privacy Considerations**
Each scenario must be tested across all privacy levels:
- `ferpa_strict`: Maximum privacy
- `ferpa_standard`: Standard educational privacy
- `mask`: Basic masking
- `none`: No masking (for matching only)

The plan must provide clear, privacy-aware solutions for each scenario.

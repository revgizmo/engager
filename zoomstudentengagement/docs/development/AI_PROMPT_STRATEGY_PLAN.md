## AI Prompt Strategy Plan

Project: zoomstudentengagement

### Purpose
Define a comprehensive, standardized strategy for memorializing, organizing, optimizing, and maintaining AI agent prompts used across this repository. Aligns with CRAN-bound, privacy-first development.

### Current Prompt Inventory (Initial)
- `AI_AGENT_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md`: Prompt generation workflow
- `AI_AGENT_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`: Prompt review workflow
- docs/development/process/organization-prompt*.md: Organization prompts
- Additional planning prompts within docs/development and planning

### Goals and Success Metrics
- Consistency: 100% of prompts use standardized template
- Effectiveness: ≥90% success satisfaction in usage feedback
- Maintainability: Versioned with change history; quarterly review cadence
- Integration: Prompts reference project rules and CRAN targets

### Standardization Guidelines
- Use headings: Mission, Context files, Task, Focus, Key requirements, Success criteria, Start here
- Include explicit branch creation and PR rules where implementation is required
- Cite privacy-first and CRAN compliance where relevant
- Keep copyable agent messages ≤150 lines, concise and actionable

### Version Control and Change Tracking
- Store prompts in `docs/development/` or root named files
- Use semantic version tags in each prompt header: `Version: X.Y.Z`
- Record changes in a "Changelog" section at bottom

### Maintenance and Review Cadence
- Quarterly audit using the implementation guide
- Open a GitHub issue for each prompt needing update; link PRs

### Performance Measurement
- Track prompt outcomes in audit notes: success rate, confusion points
- Tag recurring failure modes and update templates accordingly

### Organization Structure
- Primary index: `docs/README.md` and `DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Strategy docs: this file and implementation guide
- Operational prompts grouped under `docs/development/process/`

### Roadmap Phases
1. Foundation: Audit and categorize; adopt templates
2. Optimization: Implement standardized templates; add evaluation framework
3. Enhancement: Add A/B testing, feedback collection, automation hooks
4. Maintenance: Quarterly audit and continuous improvement

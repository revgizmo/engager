# Codebase Audit Log

This log tracks findings, decisions, and progress during the 2024-06 codebase audit for the zoomstudentengagement R package.

## Audit Goals
- Ensure code quality, maintainability, and CRAN readiness
- Improve naming, style, modularity, error handling, documentation, and test coverage

## Function Naming & API Consistency Audit (Issue #16)

### Checklist
- [ ] Inventory all exported functions
- [ ] Review and standardize function names
- [ ] Review and standardize argument names/order
- [ ] Propose and log changes in AUDIT_LOG.md
- [ ] Refactor code, tests, and docs
- [ ] Update NEWS.md for breaking changes
- [ ] Run and pass all tests
- [ ] Commit, push, and open PR

### Detailed Audit Plan

#### Naming Conventions
- **Function Names:**
  - Follow tidyverse style: use verbs (e.g., `process_zoom_transcript`, `summarize_transcript_metrics`).
  - Avoid acronyms unless widely recognized (e.g., `fliwc` should be renamed to `summarize_transcript_metrics`).
  - Ensure names are descriptive and self-explanatory.
- **Argument Names:**
  - Use consistent naming across similar functions (e.g., `transcript_file_path`, `consolidate_comments`).
  - Avoid abbreviations unless necessary (e.g., `max_pause_sec` is acceptable, but `max_pause` is not).
  - Document default values and constraints clearly.

#### API Consistency
- **Argument Order:**
  - Standardize the order of arguments across similar functions (e.g., `transcript_file_path` should be the first argument for transcript processing functions).
  - Group related arguments together (e.g., `consolidate_comments`, `max_pause_sec`).
- **Return Types:**
  - Ensure consistent return types for similar functions (e.g., all transcript processing functions should return a tibble).
  - Document return types and structures clearly in roxygen2 comments.

#### Documentation and Examples
- **Roxygen2 Comments:**
  - Ensure all exported functions have comprehensive roxygen2 documentation.
  - Include examples that demonstrate common use cases and edge cases.
  - Document any side effects or dependencies.
- **Examples:**
  - Provide runnable examples for all exported functions.
  - Include examples that cover typical and edge-case scenarios.

#### Deprecation and Backward Compatibility
- **Deprecation Strategy:**
  - Use `@deprecated` tag in roxygen2 comments for functions to be deprecated.
  - Provide clear migration paths in documentation and examples.
  - Update `NEWS.md` to document breaking changes and deprecations.
- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Ensure new changes do not break existing code without clear communication.
  - Use version constraints in `DESCRIPTION` to manage dependencies.

#### Logging and Transparency
- **Logging:**
  - Log all findings, decisions, and changes in `AUDIT_LOG.md`.
  - Include rationale for each change to ensure transparency.
  - Use a consistent format for logging (e.g., date, finding, decision, action).
- **Review Process:**
  - Propose changes in a dedicated section of `AUDIT_LOG.md`.
  - Review and discuss changes with the team before implementation.
  - Document the review process and outcomes.

_Note: This inventory was cross-checked against NAMESPACE and the test suite as of 2025-05-05. All exported functions are now tested. Deprecated or removed functions are not listed here._

### [2024-06-10]
- Started function naming and API audit. Logged initial findings for first five exported functions. Will continue with the rest of the inventory and propose changes as needed.

### [2024-06-10]
- Completed inventory of all exported functions. Identified several areas for improvement:
  1. Acronym usage (e.g., `fliwc` should be `summarize_transcript_metrics`)
  2. Function name length (several functions have overly long names)
  3. Consistency in naming patterns (e.g., `make_` vs `create_` vs `filter_`)
  4. Deprecated functions that should be removed
  5. Argument naming consistency across similar functions

Next steps:
1. Create issues for each category of changes
2. Prioritize changes based on impact and effort
3. Begin implementing changes in order of priority

### [2024-06-10] Test Suite Restoration Plan

Before continuing with the function naming/API refactor, we will restore the test suite to a green (passing) state. This ensures a solid foundation for future changes and makes it easier to catch regressions. The plan is as follows:

1. **Checkpoint Current Work:**
   - All WIP changes have been committed to the audit branch.
   - A new branch (`bugfix/tests-green`) has been created for test restoration.

2. **Run All Tests:**
   - Run the full test suite and review errors/warnings.

3. **Fix Test Data and Signatures:**
   - Update test data helpers to include all required columns.
   - Ensure all test calls match current function signatures.

4. **Iterate:**
   - Re-run tests after each fix, addressing the next most foundational error.
   - Commit after each meaningful fix or set of related fixes.

5. **No Refactoring Until Green:**
   - Pause all renaming/refactoring until the test suite passes.

6. **Document and Review:**
   - Use clear commit messages and document changes in AUDIT_LOG.md.
   - Once green, resume refactor work incrementally.

This approach follows best practices for reliability and maintainability.

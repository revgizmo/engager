# Codebase Audit Log

This log tracks findings, decisions, and progress during the 2024-06 codebase audit for the zoomstudentengagement R package.

## Audit Goals
- Ensure code quality, maintainability, and CRAN readiness
- Improve naming, style, modularity, error handling, documentation, and test coverage

## Function Naming & API Consistency Audit (Issue #16)

### Checklist
- [ ] Inventory all exported functions
- [ ] Review and standardize function names
- [ ] Review and standardize argument names/order
- [ ] Propose and log changes in AUDIT_LOG.md
- [ ] Refactor code, tests, and docs
- [ ] Update NEWS.md for breaking changes
- [ ] Run and pass all tests
- [ ] Commit, push, and open PR

### Detailed Audit Plan

#### Naming Conventions
- **Function Names:**
  - Follow tidyverse style: use verbs (e.g., `process_zoom_transcript`, `summarize_transcript_metrics`).
  - Avoid acronyms unless widely recognized (e.g., `fliwc` should be renamed to `summarize_transcript_metrics`).
  - Ensure names are descriptive and self-explanatory.
- **Argument Names:**
  - Use consistent naming across similar functions (e.g., `transcript_file_path`, `consolidate_comments`).
  - Avoid abbreviations unless necessary (e.g., `max_pause_sec` is acceptable, but `max_pause` is not).
  - Document default values and constraints clearly.

#### API Consistency
- **Argument Order:**
  - Standardize the order of arguments across similar functions (e.g., `transcript_file_path` should be the first argument for transcript processing functions).
  - Group related arguments together (e.g., `consolidate_comments`, `max_pause_sec`).
- **Return Types:**
  - Ensure consistent return types for similar functions (e.g., all transcript processing functions should return a tibble).
  - Document return types and structures clearly in roxygen2 comments.

#### Documentation and Examples
- **Roxygen2 Comments:**
  - Ensure all exported functions have comprehensive roxygen2 documentation.
  - Include examples that demonstrate common use cases and edge cases.
  - Document any side effects or dependencies.
- **Examples:**
  - Provide runnable examples for all exported functions.
  - Include examples that cover typical and edge-case scenarios.

#### Deprecation and Backward Compatibility
- **Deprecation Strategy:**
  - Use `@deprecated` tag in roxygen2 comments for functions to be deprecated.
  - Provide clear migration paths in documentation and examples.
  - Update `NEWS.md` to document breaking changes and deprecations.
- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - Ensure new changes do not break existing code without clear communication.
  - Use version constraints in `DESCRIPTION` to manage dependencies.

#### Logging and Transparency
- **Logging:**
  - Log all findings, decisions, and changes in `AUDIT_LOG.md`.
  - Include rationale for each change to ensure transparency.
  - Use a consistent format for logging (e.g., date, finding, decision, action).
- **Review Process:**
  - Propose changes in a dedicated section of `AUDIT_LOG.md`.
  - Review and discuss changes with the team before implementation.
  - Document the review process and outcomes.

### Exported Functions Inventory
- `%>%` (pipe operator)
  - **Status:** OK (standard magrittr import)
- `hello()`
  - **Finding:** Example/demo function, not part of package API. 
  - **Recommendation:** Remove from exports or move to internal if not needed for users.
- `mask_user_names_by_metric()`
  - **Status:** Name is descriptive and follows tidyverse style (verb + object).
  - **Arguments:** Consider if `metric` and `target_student` are consistently named across similar functions.
- `fliwc()`
  - **Status:** Name is an acronym; consider if a more descriptive name (e.g., `summarize_transcript_metrics()`) would improve clarity for new users.
  - **Arguments:** Review for consistency with other transcript-processing functions.
- `write_transcripts_summary()`
  - **Status:** Name is clear and follows tidyverse style.
  - **Arguments:** OK, but check for consistency with other write/save functions.

### [2024-06-10]
- Started function naming and API audit. Logged initial findings for first five exported functions. Will continue with the rest of the inventory and propose changes as needed.

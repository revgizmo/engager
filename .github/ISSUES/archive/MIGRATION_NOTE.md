# Issue Migration Note

## Migration Date: January 2025

This directory contains local issue files that have been migrated to GitHub issues as part of the issue tracking alignment project.

## Migration Mapping

### Local Files → GitHub Issues

1. **`fix_r_cmd_check_warnings.md`** → **GitHub #21** ([Audit: Review dependencies and CRAN readiness](https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement_cursor/issues/21))
   - **Content**: CRAN compliance checklist, R-CMD-check warnings, action items
   - **Labels**: `priority:high`, `audit`, `CRAN:submission`, `compliance`

2. **`make_clean_names_df_test_warnings.md`** → **GitHub #24** ([Fix: Restore passing test suite and clean up test warnings](https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement_cursor/issues/24))
   - **Content**: Test warning details, vector length handling, proposed solutions
   - **Labels**: `bug`, `priority:high`, `audit`, `area:testing`

## Rationale

- **Single Source of Truth**: GitHub issues provide better collaboration and tracking
- **No Duplication**: Content consolidated into existing issues instead of creating duplicates
- **Better Integration**: Issues linked to master audit tracking (#15)
- **Improved Workflow**: Native GitHub features for labels, milestones, and automation

## Status

✅ **Migration Complete**: All local issue content has been successfully integrated into GitHub issues.

## Next Steps

- Use GitHub issues for all future issue tracking
- Reference GitHub issue numbers in documentation and commits
- Monitor progress through GitHub's native issue management features

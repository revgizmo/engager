title: Repo hygiene: Test data, ignores, and layout
labels: enhancement, maintenance
---

Tasks
- Move large `.rds` to `tests/testthat/fixtures/` or release assets; ensure `.Rbuildignore` excludes
- Keep minimal example data in `inst/extdata/`
- Ensure `scripts/` remain ignored and reproducible
- Add `tests/testthat/helper-fixtures.R` utilities

## Branch Management and Workflow Improvements

### Recent Branch Pruning Experience (2025-08-13)
Successfully pruned 4 stale branches and learned valuable lessons about Git workflow:

#### Pruned Branches
- ✅ `origin/feature/status-update-2025-08-08` - Status documentation (merged)
- ✅ `origin/fix/name-matching-privacy-masking-issue-160` - Privacy implementation (merged)
- ✅ `origin/cursor/prepare-product-requirements-document-for-realignment-e85c` - PRD updates (merged)
- ✅ `origin/cursor/user-perspective-review-of-r-package-45f9` - Issue backup functionality (merged)

#### Key Learnings
1. **Git Merge Strategy Sophistication**: ORT (Ostensibly Recursive's Twin) strategy automatically handled "conflicts" that weren't actually conflicts
2. **Compatible Changes**: Despite overlapping work, changes were compatible and merged cleanly
3. **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: Git recognized that changes could be merged without manual intervention
4. **Branch Lifecycle Management**: Regular pruning prevents repository bloat and confusion

#### Workflow Improvements
- **Pre-PR Validation**: Run `scripts/pre-pr-validation.R` before creating PRs
- **Context Updates**: Commit context files before PR creation
- **Admin Override**: Use `--admin` flag for merging when branch protection is enabled
- **Remote Cleanup**: Use `git fetch --prune` to clean up deleted remote branches

#### Best Practices Established
- Check branch status with `git branch -r --merged origin/main`
- Verify unmerged branches with `git log --oneline <branch> --not origin/main`
- Use `git show --stat` to understand commit impact
- Document branch decisions and rationale

Acceptance criteria
- Package tarball excludes large artifacts
- Tests rely on small, deterministic fixtures
- Clear layout for data and scripts
- **Branch management workflow documented and automated**
- **Regular branch pruning process established**

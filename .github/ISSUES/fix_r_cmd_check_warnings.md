# Fix R-CMD-check Warnings

## Description
The package currently has several R-CMD-check warnings that should be addressed. These warnings are temporarily being ignored in the GitHub Actions workflow to allow PRs to pass, but they should be fixed for CRAN submission.

## Current Warnings
1. Non-portable file name:
   - `inst/Zoom_Student_Engagement_Analysis_student_summary_report.Rmd`
   - Should be renamed to use underscores instead of spaces

2. Non-standard license specification:
   - Current: "TBD Open Source"
   - Should be updated to a standard license (e.g., MIT, GPL-3)

3. Directory with check directory name:
   - `./..Rcheck`
   - Should be added to .Rbuildignore

## Notes to Address
1. Hidden files/directories:
   - Several .DS_Store files
   - .Rproj.user directory
   - .git directory
   - Should be added to .Rbuildignore

2. Missing Authors@R field in DESCRIPTION
   - Should be added for CRAN compliance

3. Global variable bindings:
   - Several undefined global variables in R code
   - Should be properly imported in NAMESPACE

4. LazyData without data directory
   - Either add a data directory or remove LazyData: true from DESCRIPTION

## Action Items
- [ ] Rename Rmd file to use underscores
- [ ] Update license in DESCRIPTION
- [ ] Add check directory to .Rbuildignore
- [ ] Add hidden files/directories to .Rbuildignore
- [ ] Add Authors@R field to DESCRIPTION
- [ ] Fix global variable bindings
- [ ] Address LazyData issue
- [ ] Re-enable warning-as-error in GitHub Actions workflow

## Priority
Medium - These issues should be fixed before CRAN submission but are not blocking current development.

## Related Issues
- Part of CRAN submission preparation
- Related to package structure and documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All R-CMD-check warnings are resolved
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow is updated to treat warnings as errors again
- [ ] Package passes R-CMD-check with no warnings
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect any changes

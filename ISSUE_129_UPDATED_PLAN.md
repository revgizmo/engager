# Issue #129 Implementation Plan
## Real-World Testing with Confidential Data

**Status**: Issue #115 RESOLVED ✅ - dplyr→Base R conversions complete and validated  
**Priority**: HIGH (CRAN submission blocker)  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Approach**: Use existing real-world testing infrastructure

---

## 🎯 **Current State**

### **✅ Issue #115 Resolution Impact**
- **dplyr→Base R conversions**: COMPLETE and VALIDATED (19/19 functions)
- **No conversion bugs**: All functions produce identical outputs
- **Base R stability**: Resolved original segfault issues
- **User role clarified**: No need for users to fix conversion issues

### **🎯 Issue #129 Focus**
With Issue #115 resolved, focus entirely on:
1. **Real confidential data testing** (not conversion validation)
2. **Privacy features validation** with actual student data
3. **Performance testing** with large datasets
4. **FERPA compliance verification** in production scenarios

---

## 📋 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Use Existing Infrastructure**
All user instructions are in `scripts/real_world_testing/README.md`:
- ✅ **Complete setup guide** with security warnings
- ✅ **Data preparation instructions** 
- ✅ **Test execution commands** and scenarios
- ✅ **Troubleshooting guide** and success criteria

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Follow the comprehensive guide in:
# scripts/real_world_testing/README.md
```

## 📈 **Timeline & Dependencies**

### **Week 1: Setup & Core Testing**
- **Days 1-2**: Environment setup and data preparation
- **Days 3-5**: Core functionality and privacy testing
- **Day 6**: Performance testing with large datasets

### **Week 2: Integration & Documentation**
- **Days 7-8**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Days 9-10**: Documentation and CRAN preparation

### **Dependencies**
- ✅ **Issue #115**: RESOLVED (dplyr→Base R conversions complete)
- ✅ **Issue #130**: RESOLVED (documentation complete)
- 🔄 **Issue #129**: IN PROGRESS (this plan)

---

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

### **CRAN Readiness**
- [x] Package validated with real Zoom transcript data ✅ **PASSED**
- [ ] Privacy features tested with confidential student data ❌ **NEEDS FIX**
- [x] Performance acceptable with large datasets ✅ **PASSED**
- [ ] FERPA compliance verified in production scenarios ❌ **NEEDS FIX**

### **Documentation**
- [x] Real-world usage patterns documented ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] Any issues found and resolved ✅ **FIXED**
- [x] Performance characteristics documented ✅ **PASSED**
- [ ] Privacy validation completed ❌ **NEEDS FIX**

### **Test Results Summary (2025-08-11)**
- **Total Tests**: 12
- **Passed**: 3 (25%)
- **Failed**: 3 (25%)
- **Issues Found**: Roster file path configuration
- **Fix Applied**: Corrected `load_roster()` function calls

---

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. **✅ Follow `scripts/real_world_testing/README.md`** for all user instructions
2. **✅ Execute real-world testing** with confidential data (completed)
3. **✅ Document findings** for CRAN submission (in progress)
4. **🔄 Re-run tests** with the fixed roster file path
5. **📋 Address remaining issues** (privacy features, FERPA compliance)

### **Immediate Action Required**
```bash
# Re-run the tests with the fix applied
cd zoom_real_world_testing/
./run_tests.sh
```

### **Expected Improvement**
With the roster file path fix, the failed tests should now pass:
- ✅ **name_matching**: Should now work correctly
- ✅ **visualization**: Should now work correctly  
- ✅ **privacy_features**: Should now work correctly

**Key Insight**: With Issue #115 resolved, we can focus entirely on real-world testing with confidential data, which is the actual CRAN blocker that needs attention.

# AI Agent Prompt Template

## üéØ **Quick Usage**

**Step 1: Ask AI to create planning documents**
```
"Make me a prompt for issue [NUMBER] [PHASE] with @AI_AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md"
```

**Step 2: Ask AI to provide short message**
```
"Now give me a short message to copy to the new AI chat"
```

The AI will first create detailed planning documents, then provide a concise message for the new AI agent.

## üéØ **Workflow**

1. **Ask AI to create planning documents**: "Make me a prompt for issue [NUMBER] [PHASE] with @AI_AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md"
2. **AI creates detailed files**: Consolidated plan and implementation guide
3. **Ask AI for short message**: "Now give me a short message to copy to the new AI chat"
4. **Copy short message** to a new AI chat
5. **Monitor progress** and provide guidance

## üìù **Required Files to Create**

**The AI will create these files automatically:**

### **1. Consolidated Plan**: `docs/development/ISSUE_[ISSUE_NUMBER]_CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md`
Documents what was accomplished and plans remaining work.

### **2. Implementation Guide**: `ISSUE_[ISSUE_NUMBER]_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
Provides specific instructions for the next AI agent.

## üí° **Pro Tips**

- **Two-step process** - First create documents, then get short message
- **Be specific** - Include the issue number and phase description
- **Let AI handle details** - The AI will create all required files
- **Short message** - Keep the chat message concise and actionable

## üéØ **Example Usage**

```
User: "Make me a prompt for issue 160 phase 2 with @AI_AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md"
AI: [Creates detailed consolidated plan and implementation guide]

User: "Now give me a short message to copy to the new AI chat"
AI: [Provides concise message ready to copy/paste]
```

## üìù **Short Message Format**

The short message should be **concise and actionable**:

```
Mission: Implement Phase 2 of Issue #160 for implementation.

FIRST: Create new branch for this work:
git checkout -b feature/issue-160-Phase-2-implementation
git push -u origin feature/issue-160-Phase-2-implementation

Context files to link:
- @PROJECT.md (Project status and CRAN readiness)
- @full-context.md (Complete project context)
- @ISSUE_160_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (MAIN IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE)
- @docs/development/ISSUE_160_CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md (Overall plan)

Your task: Follow the implementation guide to complete Phase 2 of Issue #160.

Focus: implementation work for Issue #160 Phase 2

Key requirements:
- Follow project coding standards and privacy-first approach
- Implement functionality according to specifications
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Test thoroughly with realistic scenarios
- Ensure CRAN compliance

Success criteria: Phase 2 completed, documented, tested, and ready for review.

Start with the implementation guide and follow the step-by-step plan.
```

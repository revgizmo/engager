# AI Agent Prompt Template

## üéØ **Quick Usage**

**Copy this template and fill in the variables:**

```
Mission: Implement [PHASE_DESCRIPTION] of Issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER] for [WORK_TYPE].

FIRST: Create new branch for this work:
git checkout -b feature/issue-[ISSUE_NUMBER]-[PHASE_DESCRIPTION]-[WORK_TYPE]
git push -u origin feature/issue-[ISSUE_NUMBER]-[PHASE_DESCRIPTION]-[WORK_TYPE]

Context files to link:
- @PROJECT.md (Project status and CRAN readiness)
- @full-context.md (Complete project context)
- @ISSUE_[ISSUE_NUMBER]_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (MAIN IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE)
- @docs/development/ISSUE_[ISSUE_NUMBER]_CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md (Overall plan)

Your task: Follow the implementation guide to complete [PHASE_DESCRIPTION] of Issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER].

Focus: [WORK_TYPE] work for Issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER] [PHASE_DESCRIPTION]

Key requirements:
- Follow project coding standards and privacy-first approach
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Test thoroughly with realistic scenarios
- Ensure CRAN compliance

Success criteria: [PHASE_DESCRIPTION] completed, documented, tested, and ready for review.

Start with the implementation guide and follow the step-by-step plan.
```

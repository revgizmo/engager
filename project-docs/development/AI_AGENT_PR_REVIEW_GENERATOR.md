# AI Agent PR Review Generator

**This document guides AI agents to conduct comprehensive PR reviews and generate approval workflows for the zoomstudentengagement R package.**

## üéØ **Instructions for AI Agent**

When a user asks: **"`Please review and approve PR [NUMBER] with @AI_AGENT_PR_REVIEW_GENERATOR.md`"**

**Complete these steps automatically:**

### **Step 1: Conduct Comprehensive PR Review**

1. **Fetch PR Details**: Retrieve PR information, diff, and related context
   - Get PR title, description, and linked issues
   - Review all changed files and commit history
   - Check CI/CD status and test results
   - Verify branch protection compliance
   - Assess impact: Determine if changes are user-facing, internal, or infrastructure
   - Check for parallel work conflicts

2. **Create Review Report**: `project-docs/development/PR_[NUMBER]_REVIEW_REPORT.md`
   - Document PR scope and key changes
   - Document code quality assessment
   - Verify CRAN compliance requirements
   - Check test coverage and documentation
   - Assess privacy and security implications
   - Identify risks and benefits
   - Check for parallel work conflicts
   - Include specific recommendations and action items

3. **Create Approval Checklist**: `PR_[NUMBER]_APPROVAL_CHECKLIST.md`
   - List all requirements that must be met
   - Provide step-by-step verification process
   - Define clear approval criteria
   - Include rollback procedures if needed

### **Step 2: Generate Review Prompt**

Create a comprehensive review prompt following this format:

```
Mission: Review and approve PR #[NUMBER] for [WORK_TYPE] changes.

FIRST: Fetch and analyze the PR:
gh pr view [NUMBER] --json title,body,state,headRefName,baseRefName,author,createdAt,updatedAt
gh pr diff [NUMBER] > pr_[NUMBER]_diff.txt

Context files to link:
- @PROJECT.md (Project status and CRAN readiness)
- @full-context.md (Complete project context)
- @PR_[NUMBER]_REVIEW_REPORT.md (MAIN REVIEW REPORT)
- @PR_[NUMBER]_APPROVAL_CHECKLIST.md (Approval requirements)

Your task: Conduct comprehensive review of PR #[NUMBER] following the review report.

Focus: [WORK_TYPE] review for PR #[NUMBER]

Review requirements:
- Verify CRAN compliance (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Check test coverage >90%
- Validate documentation completeness
- Ensure privacy-first approach maintained
- Review code quality and style compliance
- [WORK_TYPE]-specific requirements (see below)

Approval criteria: All checklist items completed, no blocking issues, ready for merge.

Start with the review report and follow the comprehensive checklist.
```

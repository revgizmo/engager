# ü§ñ AI Agent Handoff Template
## Standardized Handoff Process for Background Agent Work

**Purpose**: This document provides a standardized process for AI agents to create comprehensive handoff documents when completing background work that needs to be continued by another agent.

**When to Use**: When you've been asked to complete work that will be handed off to another AI agent for continuation.

## üéØ **Example Usage**

**User asks**: "When you're done with the rest of the work, finish by following @AI_AGENT_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md to create the handoff document for the next AI agent"

**AI completes**:
1. Creates handoff branch: `handoff/2025-01-27`
2. Creates `docs/Project_Handoff_2025-01-27_audit.md`
3. Creates `docs/AI_AGENT_HANDOFF_MESSAGE.md`
4. Commits and pushes both documents
5. Provides summary of handoff readiness

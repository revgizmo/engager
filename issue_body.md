## CRAN Submission Blocker: Project Management Restructuring

**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: Project Management  
**Area**: Infrastructure  
**CRAN Impact**: Blocker

### Background
The premortem analysis revealed that our current project status assessment is significantly optimistic and requires fundamental restructuring before CRAN submission.

### Current vs. Reality Assessment

| **Current PROJECT.md Status** | **Premortem Reality** |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| "EXCELLENT - Very Close to CRAN Ready" | **NOT READY - Critical Blockers Identified** |
| "R CMD Check: 0 ERRORS, 0 WARNINGS, 3 NOTES" | **3 notes are CRAN blockers, not minor** |
| "Test Coverage: 83.41% (good progress)" | **78.15% coverage is insufficient for production** |
| "Estimated Time to CRAN: 1-2 weeks" | **Minimum 3 weeks with critical blockers** |
| "Confidence Level: HIGH" | **Confidence Level: LOW until blockers resolved** |

### Required Actions

#### 1. Project Status Overhaul
- [ ] Update PROJECT.md with new status and timeline
- [ ] Revise all status communications
- [ ] Update stakeholder expectations
- [ ] Add premortem analysis findings to documentation

#### 2. Issue Management Restructuring
- [ ] Create 6 new critical issues (#116-#122)
- [ ] Update 7 existing issue priorities (upgrade to Critical/High)
- [ ] Restructure GitHub project board with new priorities
- [ ] Establish clear issue dependencies
- [ ] Update issue labels and workflows

#### 3. Development Workflow Changes
- [ ] Add privacy-first development requirements
- [ ] Include ethical review process
- [ ] Add performance validation requirements
- [ ] Update code review checklist
- [ ] Add security review requirements

#### 4. Resource Reallocation
- [ ] Reallocate 40% of time to privacy/ethics (was ~5%)
- [ ] Reallocate 25% of time to performance optimization (was ~10%)
- [ ] Reallocate 20% of time to real-world testing (was ~5%)
- [ ] Update development standards and processes

#### 5. Risk Management Integration
- [ ] Establish privacy risk monitoring
- [ ] Add ethical risk tracking
- [ ] Create CRAN-specific risk assessment
- [ ] Implement performance risk monitoring
- [ ] Add legal compliance monitoring

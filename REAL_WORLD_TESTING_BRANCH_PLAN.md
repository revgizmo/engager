# Real-World Testing Branch Management Plan

## Current Situation

**Branch**: `feature/standalone-real-world-testing`
**Status**: Significantly diverged from main (25+ commits behind)
**Last Commit**: `4a7fbf5` - "fix: Correct load_roster function and manual workflow parameter usage"

## Issues Identified

### ðŸš¨ Critical Conflicts with Main
1. **Missing Recent Fixes**: No Cursor Bot fixes (PR #119, #120), test warnings cleanup (PR #118), or segfault resolution (PR #112)
2. **Outdated Documentation**: Missing BUGBOT.md, CURSOR_INTEGRATION.md, and other recent documentation
3. **Conflicting File Changes**: Many R functions modified in both branches with different approaches
4. **Missing CRAN Compliance**: No test environment output fixes or recent improvements
5. **Outdated .gitignore**: Missing recent improvements and proper file organization

### ðŸ“Š Divergence Analysis
- **25+ commits** in main not in this branch
- **92 files changed** with significant modifications
- **7,826 insertions, 7,317 deletions** - major divergence
- **No merge conflicts detected** but significant functional differences

## Valuable Work to Preserve

### âœ… Real-World Testing Infrastructure
- **Standalone testing environments** for confidential data
- **Security-focused testing practices** with proper warnings
- **Manual workflow documentation** (`whole_game_real_world.Rmd`)
- **Data validation tools** and setup scripts
- **Automated and manual testing workflows**

### âœ… New Functionality
- **`write_engagement_metrics()` function** for CSV export
- **Enhanced data export capabilities** with list column handling
- **Comprehensive testing infrastructure** in `scripts/real_world_testing/`

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Backup and Assessment âœ…
- [x] Document current state and plan
- [x] Run context script to capture current status
- [x] Commit documentation
- [ ] Create backup branch: `backup/real-world-testing-$(date)`

### Phase 2: Rebase Strategy (Pending Guidance)
**Option A: Full Rebase**
- Rebase branch on current main
- Resolve conflicts systematically
- Update documentation to match current structure
- Test functionality with current package API

**Option B: Selective Cherry-Pick**
- Identify specific commits to preserve
- Cherry-pick valuable functionality to new branch
- Recreate infrastructure on current main

**Option C: Preserve for Future**
- Keep branch as-is for future work
- Recreate real-world testing work when time permits

### Phase 3: Integration (Pending Guidance)
- Resolve conflicts with recent fixes
- Update documentation structure
- Ensure compatibility with current package API
- Test all functionality
- Create new PR when ready

## Technical Details

### Files with Significant Changes
- **R/ functions**: 20+ functions modified
- **Documentation**: Complete restructuring
- **Scripts**: Major infrastructure additions
- **Tests**: Updated test files
- **Vignettes**: Modified content

### Key New Features
1. **`write_engagement_metrics()`**: CSV export with list column handling
2. **Real-world testing scripts**: Complete infrastructure
3. **Security-focused testing**: Proper data privacy practices
4. **Manual workflows**: Step-by-step analysis guides

### Conflicts to Resolve
1. **Function signatures**: Many R functions have different implementations
2. **Documentation structure**: Completely different organization
3. **Script modifications**: Both branches modified scripts differently
4. **Test updates**: Different approaches to testing

## Decision Points

### Immediate Actions
- [x] Document plan
- [x] Run context script
- [x] Commit documentation
- [ ] Create backup branch
- [ ] Await further guidance

### Future Considerations
- **Timeline**: When should this work be integrated?
- **Priority**: How important is real-world testing infrastructure?
- **Resources**: Available time for conflict resolution
- **Strategy**: Rebase vs. recreate vs. preserve

## Notes

- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-04
- **Branch Age**: ~1 week old
- **Complexity**: High - significant divergence
- **Value**: High - real-world testing is important
- **Risk**: Medium - complex conflict resolution needed

**Status**: Awaiting guidance on next steps after backup creation.

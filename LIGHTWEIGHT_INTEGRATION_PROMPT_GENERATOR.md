# Lightweight Integration Prompt Generator

**This document guides AI agents to implement lightweight integration of the AI-assisted PR review system into project documentation.**

## üéØ **Instructions for AI Agent**

When a user asks: **"Please implement the lightweight integration plan with @LIGHTWEIGHT_INTEGRATION_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md"**

**Complete these steps automatically:**

### **Step 1: Analyze Current Documentation**

1. **Review Current Files**: Check CONTRIBUTING.md, PROJECT.md, README.md
2. **Identify Integration Points**: Find where PR review process should be added
3. **Assess Current Workflow**: Understand existing development process
4. **Check System Status**: Verify feature branch and system files

### **Step 2: Implement Documentation Updates**

1. **Update CONTRIBUTING.md**: Add lightweight PR review section
2. **Update PROJECT.md**: Add development workflow reference
3. **Update README.md**: Add development section with PR review mention
4. **Preserve System Files**: Ensure full system remains accessible

### **Step 3: Execute System Integration**

1. **Merge Feature Branch**: Integrate system into main branch
2. **Add Usage Documentation**: Create guidance for when to use full system
3. **Update File References**: Ensure all links work correctly
4. **Close Issue #337**: Mark as completed with lightweight approach

### **Step 4: Generate Implementation Summary**

Create a comprehensive summary of the integration work completed.

## üìã **Template Variables**

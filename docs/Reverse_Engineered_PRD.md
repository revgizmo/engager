## 1. Purpose

### Problem Statement
Instructors and educational researchers lack systematic tools to analyze student engagement patterns from Zoom session transcripts. Current manual analysis is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks privacy protection for sensitive student data. There's a critical need for automated, privacy-first tools that can process Zoom transcripts and provide insights into participation equity while ensuring FERPA compliance.

### Why This Package Exists
The `zoomstudentengagement` package addresses the gap between raw Zoom transcript data and actionable educational insights. It transforms unstructured transcript files into structured engagement metrics, enabling data-driven decisions about classroom participation while maintaining strict privacy standards.

### User Pain Points Addressed
- **Manual Processing**: Eliminates hours of manual transcript parsing and analysis
- **Privacy Concerns**: Provides built-in data anonymization and FERPA compliance
- **Participation Equity**: Focuses specifically on identifying participation patterns and inequities
- **Data Quality**: Handles messy transcript data with intelligent name matching and cleaning
- **Scalability**: Processes multiple sessions and large datasets efficiently

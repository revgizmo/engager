# Pre-PR Review: Package rename to `engager`

This review follows `docs/development/AI_AGENT_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`.

## Quick checklist
- Confirm identity changes: DESCRIPTION, package doc, tests/docs updated
- Inventory remaining old-name mentions and classify actions
- Validate build hygiene (.Rbuildignore, cran skeleton, logs dir)
- Check CI/workflows for minimal, non-breaking change
- Confirm deferment strategy with explicit TODOs for repo URLs/badges
- Note validation status and next actions to reach 0E/0W/≤1N

## Summary assessment
- Scope adhered to: rename-only, no API changes, minimal CI/doc touch.
- Changes are reversible; main branch untouched; branch commits are small.
- CRAN readiness pending (R not available here); logs placeholders added.

## Findings: remaining old-name mentions
- README.md / README.Rmd
  - Diagnostics examples use `options(zoomstudentengagement.*)`
  - Multiple pkgdown links and badges reference old repo (intentional; TODO after repo rename)
- Tests/scripts
  - `test_all_examples.R`: several `package = "zoomstudentengagement"` remain in `system.file()` calls
- NEWS.md
  - Mentions `options(zoomstudentengagement.verbose)` in a note
- Roxygen/package doc
  - `R/engager-package.R` long example block still shows `library(zoomstudentengagement)`
- Vignettes (`vignettes/*.Rmd`)
  - Authors, `library(zoomstudentengagement)`, options keys, and `system.file(..., package = "zoomstudentengagement")`
  - Pkgdown URLs point to old site (defer with TODO)
- Man page
  - `man/zoomstudentengagement.Rd` retains old branding; will be regenerated by roxygen
- Inst/docs
  - `inst/Zoom_Student_Engagement_Analysis_*.Rmd` titles and various docs headings contain “Zoom Student Engagement”
- Not found
  - `zoom_student_engagement` (snake) and `zoom-student-engagement` (kebab) variants

## Simplifications and improvements (lean)
- DESCRIPTION Title: change to a neutral/brand-aligned form, e.g., `engager: Analyze Student Engagement from Zoom Transcripts` (no functional impact)
- Normalize examples: update options keys in README and vignettes to `engager.*` for consistency
- Concentrate TODO markers: ensure a single TODO header before URL/BugReports in DESCRIPTION and a short TODO block in README for badges/links
- Roxygen examples: trim or update the package-level example to `library(engager)` to avoid stale references; regenerate docs

## CI/workflows
- Display names unchanged (generic); no repo-path edits performed
- Keep as-is; second pass for URLs after repo rename

## Build hygiene
- `.Rbuildignore` includes docs/, cran/, and check-logs/ entries (good)
- `cran/cran-comments.md` skeleton present
- Logs placeholder in `docs/check-logs/` present

## Validation plan and status
- Pending (no R in this environment):
  - roxygenise → regenerate NAMESPACE/man
  - tests → update any remaining references and run
  - `devtools::check(args = c("--as-cran"))` target 0E/0W/≤1N
  - pkgdown build (local only)
- After repo rename:
  - Update DESCRIPTION URLs, README badges/links, pkgdown `url:`; rebuild site

## Actionable next steps (pre-PR)
- Textual fixes (safe):
  - README(.Rmd): replace `options(zoomstudentengagement.*)` → `engager.*`
  - NEWS.md: update options reference to `engager.verbose`
  - `R/engager-package.R`: update long example to `library(engager)`
  - `test_all_examples.R`: replace remaining `package = "zoomstudentengagement"` → `"engager"`
- Defer with TODO (post–repo-rename):
  - DESCRIPTION `URL`/`BugReports`, README badges/links, pkgdown `url:`
- Run validation locally; capture outputs to `docs/check-logs/`; finalize `cran/cran-comments.md`

## Risk check
- Name conflict on CRAN not verified here (R unavailable) → verify in validation pass
- Broken links risk mitigated with TODO deferrals until repo rename
- CI drift avoided; no toolchain edits

## Go/No-Go
- Go for PR once the “Textual fixes (safe)” items are applied and validation logs are captured. If deferring those fixes, add explicit TODOs to PR description and tracking issue.

- **Cross-validation**: Compare and synthesize results between platforms
- **Phase-based research**: 4 phases covering legal, technical, ethical, and integration aspects
- **Synthesis process**: Create unified findings from multiple AI perspectives

---

## üìù **Research Process Documentation**

### **Phase 1: Initial Prompt Development**

#### **Date**: August 2025
#### **Objective**: Create optimized prompts for both AI platforms

#### **Process**:
1. **Analysis of existing documentation** from `ETHICAL_ISSUES_ANALYSIS.md`
2. **Identification of AI platform strengths**:
   - ChatGPT: Technical implementation, code examples
   - Google Gemini: Legal research, academic literature, citations
3. **Prompt optimization** for each platform's capabilities
4. **Creation of synthesis templates** for combining results

#### **Key Decisions**:
- **Dual-platform approach** rather than single-platform research
- **Phase-based research** with cross-validation
- **Comprehensive prompts** covering all four ethical issues
- **Synthesis methodology** for combining results

### **Phase 2: ChatGPT Initial Response**

#### **Date**: August 2025
#### **Platform**: ChatGPT Deep Research
#### **Prompt Used**: Full ChatGPT prompt from `AI_RESEARCH_PROMPTS.md`

#### **Response Summary**:
ChatGPT requested clarification on specific implementation details:

1. **Privacy Level Parameter Scope**:
   - Global vs. per-function application
   - Definition of "partial" anonymization
   - Implementation approach

2. **FERPA Compliance Infrastructure**:
   - Authentication/logging infrastructure
   - Consent tracking implementation
   - Audit logging approach

3. **Security Implementation**:
   - File loading method (manual vs. upload)
   - Secure deletion capabilities
   - Input validation scope

4. **Implementation Roadmap**:
   - Development team size
   - Timeline requirements
   - Priority considerations

#### **Research Quality Assessment**:
- **Strengths**: Detailed technical questions, implementation-focused
- **Areas for Improvement**: Needed specific context about current package state
- **Follow-up Required**: Clarification of technical specifications

### **Phase 3: Clarification Response**

#### **Date**: August 2025
#### **Response Provided**:

**Privacy Level Parameter**:
- Global application across all 40+ functions
- Four levels: 
  - "full" (complete anonymization: Student 01, Student 02, etc.)
  - "partial" (retain roles like "Instructor" but anonymize student names)
  - "individual" (specific student name exposed, others as Student 01, Student 02, etc.)
  - "none" (actual names for authorized users only)
- Current state: Existing `mask_user_names_by_metric()` function available with `target_student` parameter

**FERPA Compliance**:
- Pure R package (no web interface)
- Manual .vtt file loading from disk
- Consent tracking as user-facing R functions
- Audit logging to local files

**Security Implementation**:
- Manual file loading through R functions
- Secure deletion as R functions
- Input validation for file paths, content, and data sanitization

**Implementation Context**:
- Current: Solo development
- Future: Potential for multiple contributors
- 2-week timeline
- Legal compliance priority
- 40+ exported functions requiring modification

#### **Research Methodology Note**:
This clarification process demonstrates the importance of providing specific technical context to AI research platforms for optimal results.

- **ChatGPT**: Emphasized intuitive user experience and clear error messages
- **Resolution**: Create comprehensive documentation while maintaining user-friendly interfaces

### **Resolution Strategy**

**Prioritized Approach:**
1. **Core Implementation First**: Focus on practical privacy features that can be implemented immediately
2. **Advanced Features Later**: Add Differential Privacy and k-Anonymity as optional features in Phase 3
3. **User Experience Priority**: Ensure all features are intuitive and well-documented
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement performance benchmarks to ensure minimal overhead

**Unresolved Issues**
- **Integration Complexity**: Advanced privacy packages may add maintenance burden

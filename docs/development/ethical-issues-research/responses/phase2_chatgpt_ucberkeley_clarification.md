## üìã **Clarification Context**

### **ChatGPT's UC Berkeley Questions**
ChatGPT asked for clarification on four key UC Berkeley-specific areas before providing targeted technical guidance:

1. **UC Berkeley Infrastructure Deployment**: Will the package be deployed in specific UC Berkeley systems?
2. **IRB Oversight**: Should we assume IRB oversight for research use cases?
3. **UC Berkeley Tool Integration**: Will the package integrate with existing UC Berkeley tools?
4. **Development Team**: Who will contribute to package development?

## üéØ **Our Clarification Response**

### **1. UC Berkeley Infrastructure Deployment**

**Answer**: The package is intended for **local instructor and researcher use** primarily, with potential for broader deployment:

**Primary Use Case**: 
- **Local Installation**: Instructors and researchers install the package locally on their own machines
- **Individual Analysis**: Each user processes their own Zoom transcripts independently
- **User-Controlled Files**: All data remains under user control (no central server)

**Potential Future Deployment**:
- **RStudio Server**: Could be deployed on UC Berkeley's RStudio Server for easier access
- **bCourses Integration**: Potential for integration with UC Berkeley's learning management system
- **Savio HPC**: Could support large-scale analysis on UC Berkeley's high-performance computing cluster
- **CalNet Authentication**: Future possibility for authenticated access

**Rationale**: Starting with local use simplifies compliance and deployment while maintaining user control over sensitive data.

### **2. IRB Oversight Assumptions**

**Answer**: **Teaching/Classroom Analysis Only** - No research currently planned:

**Teaching/Classroom Analysis** (Sole Focus):
- **No IRB Required**: Internal classroom analysis for teaching improvement
- **Pedagogical Use**: Focus on equitable participation and teaching effectiveness
- **FERPA Compliance**: Primary compliance requirement
- **Institutional Review**: May require departmental or institutional review
- **No Research Intent**: No plans for formal research studies or academic publication

**Research Use Cases** (Not Applicable):
- **No Research Planned**: Package is not intended for formal research studies
- **No Publication Intent**: Results will not be published in academic journals
- **No Data Sharing**: No plans to share data with other researchers
- **No IRB Requirements**: No research use means no IRB oversight needed

**Rationale**: The package is designed exclusively for pedagogical use, simplifying compliance requirements and focusing on teaching effectiveness rather than research validation.

### **3. UC Berkeley Tool Integration**

**Answer**: **Standalone package** initially, with potential for future integration:

**Current Design**:
- **Standalone Operation**: Package operates independently without external dependencies
- **User-Controlled Data**: No integration with central UC Berkeley systems
- **Local File Processing**: Users provide their own Zoom transcript files

**Potential Future Integrations**:
- **CalNet Authentication**: For authenticated access to shared resources
- **Cal Answers**: For institutional data access (if approved)
- **D-Lab Systems**: For advanced analytics and visualization support
- **bCourses**: For integration with course management and student data

**Rationale**: Standalone design maximizes flexibility and simplifies compliance while allowing future integration possibilities.

### **4. Development Team Structure**

**Answer**: **Primary development by lecturer** with potential for academic collaboration:

**Current Development**:
- **Primary Maintainer**: Lecturer (you) as the main developer and maintainer
- **Solo Development**: Initial development and core functionality
- **Academic Focus**: Development driven by teaching and research needs

**Potential Future Collaboration**:
- **Student Researchers**: Graduate students could contribute to specific features
- **Instructional Staff**: Teaching assistants could help with testing and documentation
- **Academic Partners**: Collaboration with other UC Berkeley faculty
- **Open Source**: Potential for broader academic community contribution

**Rationale**: Solo development maintains control and simplifies decision-making while allowing for future academic collaboration.

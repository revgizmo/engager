Thank you for that important clarification. This user-controlled file model significantly refines the package's role and responsibilities, shifting it from a potential data custodian to a specialized data processing tool. This has direct implications for compliance and design.

Based on this model, here are the revised recommendations for the `zoomstudentengagement` package.

### 1. Secure File Deletion: A User Responsibility

In the file-handling model you described, the `zoomstudentengagement` package does not create, store, or manage any persistent files on its own. It only reads user-provided files, processes their content in memory, and writes output to user-specified locations.

**Revised Recommendation:**

*   **Package Responsibility:** The package has **no responsibility** for secure file deletion. Since it never creates or takes ownership of persistent data files, there is nothing for it to delete. Its primary security obligation is to ensure that it does not create unauthorized or hidden copies of the data and that it clears sensitive information from memory after processing is complete.
*   **User Responsibility:** The user and their institution bear the full responsibility for the entire data lifecycle, including the secure storage, retention, and eventual deletion of both the input VTT files and any analytical reports generated by the package. This aligns with institutional data retention policies, which can vary significantly.[[1]](https://www.sde.idaho.gov/sped/sped-manual/files/chapters/chapter-11-procedural-safeguards/Guidelines-for-the-Management-of-Student-Records.pdf)[[2]](https://www.armstrongarchives.com/ferpa-student-records-storage/)
*   **Implementation Guidance:** The package's documentation (such as in a README file or a dedicated vignette) must explicitly state this division of responsibility. It should clearly articulate that the package operates on a "bring your own data" model, processes data transiently in memory, and that the user is solely responsible for the secure management of their files in accordance with their institution's policies and FERPA.

### 2. CRAN Policy Compliance: Strong Alignment

The user-controlled file model aligns very well with the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) policies regarding file system interactions. CRAN's primary concern is that packages do not write files to arbitrary locations without the user's explicit consent and action.[[3]](https://socialsciencedatalab.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/article/r-package/)

**Revised Recommendation:**

*   **Package Responsibility:** The package's design is inherently compliant with CRAN's core principle on file output. By requiring the user to provide a full file path for any function that saves a result, the package adheres to the best practice of making the user explicitly set the directory and file name for saved outputs.[[3]](https://socialsciencedatalab.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/article/r-package/) The developer's remaining responsibility is to ensure that any code within examples, tests, or vignettes that needs to write a file does so *only* to a temporary directory using R's built-in `tempdir()` and `tempfile()` functions. This is a strict requirement for passing the automated `R CMD check` process on CRAN.[[3]](https://socialsciencedatalab.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/article/r-package/)
*   **User Responsibility:** The user is responsible for providing valid file paths to locations where they have permission to write files.
*   **Implementation Guidance:** Continue with the current design where all file-writing functions require a user-supplied path. For CRAN submission, meticulously review all documentation examples and unit tests. Any example that demonstrates a function like `save_report(report, file = "my_report.csv")` must be wrapped to ensure it does not run during automated checks or that it writes only to a temporary location.

### 3. FERPA Compliance: A Shared Responsibility Model

This file-handling model clarifies that the R package is a tool used by a "school official" (the instructor or researcher), not a third-party vendor that receives and stores student data. This distinction is critical for defining FERPA responsibilities. Legally, the educational institution and its employees are ultimately responsible for FERPA compliance.[[4]](https://ed.link/community/ferpa/)

**Revised Recommendation:**

*   **Package Responsibility (The Compliant Tool):** The package's primary FERPA responsibility is to be a tool that *enables* compliance and does not introduce risk. This is achieved by:
    *   **Not storing data:** The described model already fulfills this.
    *   **Processing data securely:** All processing of FERPA-protected data should occur in memory.
    *   **Providing compliance-aware features:** Continue to include and enhance features for data de-identification and anonymization, as these are critical workflows for protecting student privacy.[[5]](https://rcd.ucsb.edu/resources/data-resources/anonymizing-protecting)[[6]](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereview_policies.html)
    *   **Clear Documentation:** The package documentation is its most critical compliance feature. It must clearly explain to users that they are handling FERPA-protected "education records" and are responsible for their secure handling. It should warn against sharing identifiable output with unauthorized individuals.
*   **User Responsibility (The School Official):** The user is responsible for the operational aspects of FERPA compliance. This includes:
    *   **Authorized Access:** Ensuring they have a legitimate educational interest to access the VTT files in the first place.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Storing the input VTT files and any generated reports containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in a secure, access-controlled location that complies with institutional policy.
    *   **Controlling Disclosure:** Ensuring that any reports or data derived from the package are only shared with other school officials who also have a legitimate educational interest, or that proper consent is obtained.[[7]](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/Student%20Privacy%20and%20Online%20Educational%20Services%20%28February%202014%29_0.pdf)
    *   **Data Lifecycle Management:** Managing the retention and secure deletion of all related files according to institutional and legal requirements.[[8]](https://www.venminder.com/blog/ferpa-compliant-contracts-third-party-risk-management)

### 4. Audit Logging: A Shift from Automation to Facilitation

An automated, immutable audit log is a feature of a persistent data *system* (like a database or a cloud service), which tracks all actions within that system.[[9]](https://document-logistix.com/data-management-software-for-ferpa-compliance/)[[10]](https://www.manageengine.com/products/eventlog/ferpa-compliance-reports.html) For a stateless R package that simply runs functions, this model is not applicable. The responsibility for logging disclosures remains with the institution.[[11]](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/student-records-management-ferpa-compliance)

**Revised Recommendation:**

*   **Package Responsibility (Facilitating Logs):** The package cannot and should not attempt to maintain a persistent, central audit log. Instead, it should be designed to *facilitate* the user's own record-keeping. This can be implemented as an optional logging feature. For example, analytical functions could include an argument like `log_activity = TRUE`. When enabled, the function would print to the console or return a structured object (e.g., a data frame row or list) containing key information about the operation:
    *   Timestamp of the analysis.
    *   Name of the function that was run.
    *   A hash (e.g., MD5) of the input file to create a verifiable fingerprint without storing the content.
    *   Parameters used in the analysis.
    *   The path of the output file that was generated.
*   **User Responsibility (Maintaining Records):** The user is responsible for capturing this output and maintaining it as part of their research or administrative records. This log, created and maintained by the user, would serve as the evidence needed for an institutional FERPA audit, documenting what data was accessed and for what purpose.
*   **Implementation Guidance:** Remove any plans for a self-contained, automated audit system. Replace it with a feature that generates log entries on demand. The documentation must clearly explain that this feature is a convenience to help users meet their own compliance obligations and that the user is responsible for saving and securing these logs.

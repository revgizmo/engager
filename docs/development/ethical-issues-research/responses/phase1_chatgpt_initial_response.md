## ü§ñ **Complete AI Response**

Thanks for the detailed overview. To tailor the research and solutions effectively, could you please clarify a few points:

1. For the `privacy_level` parameter:

   * Should this be applied globally across all package functions, or per function (e.g., `engagement_summary()`)?
   * What should "partial" anonymization retain (e.g., speaker roles like "Instructor" vs. anonymized student IDs)?

2. For FERPA compliance:

   * Do you have any user authentication or logging infrastructure (e.g., Shiny app, RStudio Connect) where audit logs or consent might be stored?
   * Should consent tracking be built as a user-facing feature (e.g., checkbox or data annotation)?

3. For security:

   * Are you expecting users to load `.vtt` files from disk manually, or through uploads (e.g., in a web interface)?
   * Should the package include secure file deletion capabilities or just document how users can manage that?

4. For the implementation roadmap:

   * Should I assume you have multiple contributors working in parallel, or is this solo development?

Once I have this, I can generate R code, technical documentation, and a detailed 2-week roadmap for you.

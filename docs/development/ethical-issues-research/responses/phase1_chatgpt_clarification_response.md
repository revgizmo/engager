## ü§ñ **Complete AI Response**

Thank you for asking for clarification! Here are the specific details you need:

## For the privacy_level parameter:

**Scope**: Should be applied globally across all package functions, with individual function overrides available.

**Current State**: The package already has `mask_user_names_by_metric()` function that masks names by ranking (e.g., "Student 01", "Student 02"). We need to extend this to all functions.

**Privacy Levels**:

* **"full"**: Complete anonymization (e.g., "Student 01", "Student 02")
* **"partial"**: Retain roles like "Instructor" but anonymize student names
* **"individual"**: Specific student name exposed, others as Student 01, Student 02, etc.
* **"none"**: Show actual names (for authorized users only)

**Implementation**: Add `privacy_level` parameter to all 40+ exported functions, with global defaults via `set_privacy_defaults()`.

## For FERPA compliance:

**Current Infrastructure**: This is a pure R package (no Shiny app, no web interface). Users load .vtt files from disk manually.

**Consent Tracking**: Should be built as a user-facing feature with:

* Data annotation capabilities (e.g., consent status in roster data)
* Consent validation functions
* Documentation of consent requirements

**Audit Logging**: Implement as R functions that write to local log files, not a centralized system.

## For security:

**File Loading**: Users load .vtt files from disk manually through R functions like `load_zoom_transcript()`.

**Secure Deletion**: Package should include secure file deletion capabilities as R functions, not just documentation.

**Input Validation**: Need validation for:

* File path security (prevent directory traversal)
* File content validation (ensure valid .vtt format)
* Data sanitization (prevent injection attacks)

## For the implementation roadmap:

**Development**: Currently solo development, but designed for potential multiple contributors in the future.

**Timeline**: 2-week implementation timeline with daily tasks.

**Priority**: Legal compliance (FERPA) takes highest priority over technical convenience.

**Current Package**: 40+ exported functions, already has some privacy features (mask_user_names_by_metric), needs comprehensive privacy-first redesign.

**Future Considerations**: Implementation should be designed to support collaborative development and maintainability.

Please provide R code examples, technical documentation, and a detailed 2-week roadmap based on these specifications.

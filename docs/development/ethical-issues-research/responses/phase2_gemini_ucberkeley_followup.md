## üîç **UC Berkeley Follow-up Prompt**

```
Thank you for the comprehensive institutional compliance guidance! I have one important follow-up question:

**Additional Context**: The primary maintainer of this package is a Lecturer at UC Berkeley. This adds some specific institutional considerations beyond general educational software compliance.

**Follow-up Questions**:

1. **UC Berkeley Compliance Requirements**: What specific compliance requirements does UC Berkeley have for educational software that processes student data? Are there UC Berkeley-specific policies beyond standard FERPA compliance?

2. **UC System Policies**: How do UC system-wide policies on data privacy and research ethics affect this package? Are there UC-specific guidelines I should be aware of?

3. **California Privacy Laws**: How do CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and other California privacy laws impact educational software beyond FERPA? Are there additional requirements for UC Berkeley?

4. **UC Berkeley IRB Requirements**: What specific IRB requirements exist for educational research tools at UC Berkeley? How should the package be designed to support UC Berkeley's research ethics review process?

5. **Academic Standards and Documentation**: What additional documentation, validation, or compliance features might be required for UC Berkeley adoption? Are there specific institutional review processes I should plan for?

Please provide specific guidance on these UC Berkeley considerations, including any relevant institutional policies, compliance requirements, or best practices.

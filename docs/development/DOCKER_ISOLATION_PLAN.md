# Docker Development Environment Isolation Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Return the main branch to a clean, non-Docker state while isolating Docker development work in dedicated feature branches. This ensures main branch stability while allowing Docker experimentation to continue.

## 📋 Current State Assessment

### Docker Files in Main Branch
- `Dockerfile.cursor` - Active Docker configuration for Cursor background agents
- `.cursor/environment.json` - Cursor background agent configuration
- `Dockerfile.cursor-template` - Template file (may be kept as reference)
- Docker-related documentation updates in `README.md`, `README.Rmd`, `PROJECT.md`

### Current Issues Status
- **Issue #263**: "R Package Development with Cursor Background Agents" - COMPLETED
- **Issue #244**: "Phase 2: Docker Performance Optimization" - IN PROGRESS (Docker-only work)

## 📝 Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation & Issue Management

#### 1.1 Create New GitHub Issues
- **Issue #267**: "Remove Docker Configuration from Main Branch"
- **Issue #268**: "Docker Development Environment Isolation"
- **Issue #269**: "Test Background Agent Functionality Post-Docker Removal"

#### 1.2 Update Existing Issues
- **Issue #263**: Mark as completed, note Docker-specific implementation
- **Issue #244**: Update to clarify Docker-only scope, reference new Docker epic

#### 1.3 Create Documentation
- This plan document
- Docker development workflow guide
- Background agent testing procedures

### Phase 2: Branch Strategy

#### 2.1 Branch Structure
```
main (clean, stable, no Docker customization)
├── feature/remove-docker-from-main (testing branch)
├── feature/docker-epic (umbrella branch for Docker work)
│   ├── feature/issue-244-performance-optimization (current work)
│   ├── feature/docker-background-agent-fixes (future fixes)
│   └── feature/docker-documentation (Docker guides)
└── backup/docker-experiments (safety backup)
```

#### 2.2 Branch Purposes
- **main**: Production-ready, no Docker customization
- **feature/remove-docker-from-main**: Testing branch for Docker removal
- **feature/docker-epic**: Umbrella branch for all Docker development
- **feature/issue-244-performance-optimization**: Current Docker performance work
- **backup/docker-experiments**: Safety backup of current Docker state

### Phase 3: File Management Strategy

#### 3.1 Files to Remove from Main
- `Dockerfile.cursor` - Active Docker configuration
- `.cursor/environment.json` - Cursor background agent config

#### 3.2 Files to Keep in Main (as references/templates)
- `Dockerfile.cursor-template` - Template for future Docker work
- Docker-related documentation in `docs/` directory

#### 3.3 Documentation Updates Required
- Remove Docker sections from `README.md` and `README.Rmd`
- Update `PROJECT.md` to reflect Docker work isolation
- Create Docker development guide in feature branch

### Phase 4: Testing Strategy

#### 4.1 Background Agent Testing
1. Create `feature/remove-docker-from-main` branch
2. Remove Docker customization files
3. Test background agent functionality
4. Verify main branch stability
5. Merge to main once confirmed working

#### 4.2 Testing Criteria
- Background agent starts without Docker customization
- R package development tools work normally
- All existing functionality preserved
- No regression in package building/testing

### Phase 5: Future Integration Plan

#### 5.1 Docker Work Completion Criteria
- Docker environment works without bugs
- Sufficient progress warrants main branch inclusion
- Comprehensive testing completed
- Documentation updated

#### 5.2 Integration Process
1. Complete Docker work in feature branches
2. Merge feature branches into `feature/docker-epic`
3. Test comprehensive Docker functionality
4. Create integration plan for main branch
5. Execute integration with proper testing

## 🔄 Workflow

### For Docker Development
1. Work in dedicated feature branches
2. Merge completed features into `feature/docker-epic`
3. Test thoroughly before considering main integration

### For Main Branch Development
1. Main branch remains Docker-free
2. Background agents use default Cursor behavior
3. All existing functionality preserved

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

# Segmentation Fault Integration Plan - Issues #392-394 Scope Crisis Resolution

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

### **Segmentation Fault Discovery**
During pre-PR validation, a critical segmentation fault was discovered that validates the scope crisis and requires immediate integration into our planning:

```
*** caught segfault ***
address 0x662068637573206f, cause 'invalid permissions'
```

**Location**: `run_student_reports` function during R Markdown rendering
**Trigger**: data.table library loading during vignette processing
**Impact**: Prevents successful package validation and CRAN submission

## üéØ INTEGRATION INTO SCOPE CRISIS PLANNING

### **1. Validation of Scope Crisis** ‚úÖ
The segmentation fault confirms our planning assumptions:
- **169 functions** create complex dependencies that lead to runtime failures
- **data.table integration** with massive function scope creates memory issues
- **CRAN submission** is blocked by both scope and stability issues

### **2. Enhanced Risk Assessment** üîç
**New High-Risk Area**: Runtime stability during massive scope reduction
- **Segfault Risk**: Function removal could trigger new segfaults
- **Memory Issues**: Large function scope creates memory pressure
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Complex interdependencies cause runtime failures

### **3. Enhanced Mitigation Strategy** üõ°Ô∏è
**Segfault-Specific Mitigation**:
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each batch for segfaults before proceeding
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track memory usage during function removal
- **Dependency Analysis**: Map function dependencies to prevent segfaults
- **Rollback Triggers**: Immediate rollback on any segfault occurrence

## üîß TECHNICAL INTEGRATION

### **Enhanced Function Deprecation Process**
1. **Pre-Deprecation Segfault Testing**
   ```r
   # Test package stability before each batch
   devtools::load_all()
   devtools::test()  # Check for segfaults
   ```

2. **Segfault-Safe NAMESPACE Updates**
   - Remove functions one at a time
   - Test package loading after each removal
   - Monitor for segfaults during testing

3. **Enhanced Validation Steps**
   - Package loads without segfaults
   - Core workflow functions work without crashes
   - Tests pass without runtime failures
   - Memory usage remains stable

### **Segfault Detection and Response**
1. **Automated Segfault Detection**
   ```r
   # Enhanced validation script
   tryCatch({
     devtools::test()
   }, error = function(e) {
     if (grepl("segfault", e$message)) {
       stop("SEGFAULT DETECTED - Immediate rollback required")
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Immediate Rollback Procedures**
   - Restore last working NAMESPACE
   - Identify segfault-triggering function
   - Add to "do not remove" list
   - Document segfault cause and solution

# Issues #392-394: PRD Implementation & Scope Crisis Resolution

## Current Status
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: AI Agent Workflow integration (Issue #454)
- ✅ **READY**: Function audit script created
- ✅ **READY**: Cleanup framework established
- ✅ **READY**: Execution plan documented

## Critical Discovery: Scope Crisis
**Current Reality**: 169 exported functions (956% over ideal PRD target of 16-25)
**Previous Estimates**: Issues #392-394 reference outdated counts (68 functions)
**Immediate Need**: Aggressive scope reduction and CRAN readiness planning

## Week 2 Objectives
**Goal**: Transform project from unmanageable scope to CRAN-ready state

**Success Metrics Foundation (Issue #392)**:
- Define quantified targets for adoption, performance, usability, compliance
- Establish measurement frameworks and validation procedures
- Create performance benchmarks (1MB transcript in <30 seconds)

**Aggressive Scope Reduction (Issue #393)**:
- Functions: 169 → 25-30 (82-85% reduction needed)
- Audit all 169 exported functions
- Categorize into essential/advanced/deprecated
- Implement immediate deprecation for 139-144 non-essential functions

**UX & Process Simplification (Issue #394)**:
- Ensure new users can complete analysis in <15 minutes
- Simplify core workflows and onboarding
- Streamline development processes (pre-PR validation: 25→10 minutes)
- Reduce documentation complexity (345+ → 75 files)

## Technical Requirements
- Execute function audit using existing script (update for 169 functions)
- Implement aggressive function deprecation strategy
- Streamline pre-PR validation from 4 phases to 3
- Consolidate documentation to essential files only
- Ensure CRAN compliance throughout massive scope changes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Functions: 169 → 25-30 (82-85% reduction)
- [ ] Issues: 250+ → 75 (70% reduction)
- [ ] Pre-PR time: 25 → 10 minutes (60% reduction)
- [ ] Documentation: 345+ → 75 files (78% reduction)
- [ ] CRAN-ready package with essential functionality only

## Timeline
- **Week 2**: Execute all three issues in parallel
- **Success**: Manageable project scope achieved, CRAN-ready

## Environment Considerations
- R package development environment
- GitHub workflow integration
- CRAN compliance requirements
- Existing cleanup tools available
- Massive scope reduction needed

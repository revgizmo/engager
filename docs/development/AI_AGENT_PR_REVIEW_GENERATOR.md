## üéØ **Instructions for AI Agent**

When a user asks: **"`Please review and approve PR [NUMBER] with @AI_AGENT_PR_REVIEW_GENERATOR.md`"**

**Complete these steps automatically:**

### **Step 1: Conduct Comprehensive PR Review**

1. **Fetch PR Details**: Retrieve PR information, diff, and related context
   - Get PR title, description, and linked issues
   - Review all changed files and commit history
   - Check CI/CD status and test results
   - Verify branch protection compliance
   - Assess impact: Determine if changes are user-facing, internal, or infrastructure
   - Check for parallel work conflicts

2. **Create Review Report**: `docs/development/PR_[NUMBER]_REVIEW_REPORT.md`
   - Document PR scope and key changes
   - Document code quality assessment
   - Verify CRAN compliance requirements
   - Check test coverage and documentation
   - Assess privacy and security implications
   - Identify risks and benefits
   - Check for parallel work conflicts

   - Provide step-by-step verification process
   - Define clear approval criteria
   - Include rollback procedures if needed

### **Step 2: Generate Review Prompt**

Create a comprehensive review prompt following this format:

```

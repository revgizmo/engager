## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive framework for assessing issue complexity and selecting appropriate AI models for different development tasks. This is a future enhancement that should be implemented after CRAN submission to improve development efficiency and AI-assisted workflow optimization.

## Background

During CRAN submission preparation, we identified the need for a systematic approach to:
- Assess issue complexity across multiple dimensions
- Select appropriate AI models based on task requirements
- Automate model selection for simple cases
- Maintain an evergreen framework that adapts to changing AI capabilities

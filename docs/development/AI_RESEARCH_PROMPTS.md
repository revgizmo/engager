## ü§ñ ChatGPT Deep Research Prompt

```
I'm developing an R package called "zoomstudentengagement" for analyzing student engagement from Zoom transcripts. I have FOUR CRITICAL ETHICAL ISSUES that are CRAN submission blockers and need immediate technical solutions.

**CONTEXT**: This is an R package for educational researchers and instructors to analyze student participation patterns from Zoom transcripts. The goal is equitable participation, not surveillance.

**CRITICAL ISSUES**:

1. **Issue #125: Privacy-First Defaults and Data Anonymization**
   - Need: All functions must default to anonymized output
   - Problem: Currently exposes student names by default
   - Required: `privacy_level` parameter (full, partial, individual, none), automatic name masking

2. **Issue #126: FERPA Compliance Features**
   - Need: Built-in FERPA compliance for educational software
   - Problem: No data retention controls, secure deletion, consent tracking
   - Required: Data retention, secure deletion, audit logging, consent tracking

3. **Issue #84: Security Compliance**
   - Need: Secure data handling and input validation
   - Problem: Potential vulnerabilities in data processing
   - Required: Input validation, secure file handling, security documentation

4. **Issue #85: Ethical Use Guidelines**
   - Need: Ensure equitable participation focus, not surveillance
   - Problem: Functions could be misused for surveillance
   - Required: Ethical guidelines, bias assessment, positive outcomes focus

**WHAT I NEED**:

1. **Technical Implementation Details**:
   - R code examples for privacy-first design
   - Step-by-step implementation guide for each issue
   - Specific FERPA compliance requirements for R packages
   - Security best practices for educational data

2. **Concrete Solutions**:
   - Code for `set_privacy_defaults()` function
   - Implementation of `privacy_level` parameters (full, partial, individual, none)
   - Data retention and deletion functions
   - Audit logging implementation
   - Input validation patterns

3. **Recent Developments** (2023-2025):
   - Latest FERPA requirements for educational software
   - New privacy-preserving techniques for R
   - Recent security vulnerabilities in educational tools
   - Updated ethical guidelines for student data analysis

4. **Implementation Roadmap**:
   - 2-week timeline with daily tasks
   - Testing strategies for each feature
   - Validation approaches for compliance
   - Potential pitfalls and how to avoid them

**FORMAT**: Please provide actionable technical solutions with R code examples, specific requirements, and implementation steps. Focus on practical, implementable solutions that can be coded immediately.

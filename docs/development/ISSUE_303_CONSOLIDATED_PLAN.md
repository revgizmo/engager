# Issue #303: Test Coverage Improvement - Consolidated Plan

## Issue Overview
**Issue**: test(coverage): raise coverage from 87.9% to >=90%  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Area**: Testing  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Current Status Assessment

### Coverage Analysis (Updated: 2025-08-20)
- **Current Package Coverage**: 90.29% ✅ **TARGET ACHIEVED**
- **Target Coverage**: >=90%
- **Status**: **EXCELLENT** - Target already exceeded!

### Files Requiring Attention
Based on current coverage analysis, the following files have <80% coverage and should be prioritized:

#### **Critical Priority (<70% coverage)**
1. **`R/safe_name_matching_workflow.R`: 66.78%** - Lowest coverage
   - Complex workflow with multiple edge cases
   - Privacy and name matching logic
   - Error handling paths

2. **`R/make_transcripts_summary_df.R`: 69.23%** - Second lowest
   - Data aggregation and summary functions
   - Edge cases with missing data
   - Error handling for malformed inputs

#### **Medium Priority (70-80% coverage)**
3. **`R/create_session_mapping.R`: 77.14%** - Could be improved
   - Session mapping creation logic
   - Validation and error handling
   - Edge cases with invalid inputs

#### **Lower Priority (80-90% coverage)**
4. **`R/summarize_transcript_files.R`: 80.00%** - At threshold
5. **`R/zoomstudentengagement-package.R`: 80.00%** - At threshold
6. **`R/write_metrics.R`: 82.05%** - Good but could improve
7. **`R/hash_name_consistently.R`: 83.33%** - Good but could improve
8. **`R/load_session_mapping.R`: 83.65%** - Good but could improve

### Files with Excellent Coverage (90%+)
- Most files already have excellent coverage (90%+)
- 35+ files have 100% coverage
- Core functionality is well-tested

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Focus on Critical Files (Priority 1)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Goals**: Improve the 3 files with <80% coverage to >85%

**Target Files**:
1. `R/safe_name_matching_workflow.R` (66.78% → 85%+)
2. `R/make_transcripts_summary_df.R` (69.23% → 85%+)
3. `R/create_session_mapping.R` (77.14% → 85%+)

**Tasks**:
- Analyze current test coverage gaps using `covr::file_coverage()`
- Identify untested code paths and edge cases
- Create comprehensive test scenarios for:
  - Error handling paths
  - Edge cases with invalid inputs
  - Privacy-related functionality
  - Data validation scenarios
- Add tests for missing branches and conditions

### Phase 2: Improve Medium Priority Files (Priority 2)
**Timeline**: 1 day
**Goals**: Improve files with 80-85% coverage to >90%

**Target Files**:
- `R/summarize_transcript_files.R` (80.00% → 90%+)
- `R/write_metrics.R` (82.05% → 90%+)
- `R/hash_name_consistently.R` (83.33% → 90%+)
- `R/load_session_mapping.R` (83.65% → 90%+)

### Phase 3: Edge Case and Error Path Testing (Priority 3)
**Timeline**: 1 day
**Goals**: Add comprehensive edge case and error path tests

**Focus Areas**:
- Privacy compliance testing
- Data ingestion edge cases
- Metrics calculation error scenarios
- Input validation testing
- International name handling
- Custom name variations

## Technical Requirements

### Testing Standards
- All new tests must follow `testthat` framework
- Tests should cover both positive and negative scenarios
- Edge cases must be thoroughly tested
- Error handling paths must be validated
- Privacy-related functionality must be tested

### Coverage Requirements
- Target: Maintain >=90% package coverage
- Individual files: Aim for >85% coverage where possible
- Critical files: >90% coverage for core functionality
- Error paths: 100% coverage for error handling

### Quality Criteria
- All tests must pass (`devtools::test()`)
- No new lint/style errors
- Tests should be fast and reliable
- Edge case tests should be realistic
- Privacy compliance must be validated

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
- ✅ Package coverage >=90% (ACHIEVED: 90.29%)
- [ ] All files with <80% coverage improved to >85%
- [ ] Critical files improved to >90% coverage
- [ ] Comprehensive edge case testing added
- [ ] Error handling paths fully tested

### Secondary Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass without warnings
- [ ] No new lint/style errors introduced
- [ ] Test execution time remains reasonable
- [ ] Privacy compliance thoroughly tested
- [ ] International name handling tested

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Target coverage already achieved (90.29%)
- Most files have excellent coverage
- Core functionality is well-tested

### Mitigation Strategies
- Focus on specific low-coverage files
- Add tests incrementally to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Maintain existing test quality standards
- Use realistic test data and scenarios

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables | Priority |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 1-2 days | Critical files improved to >85% | HIGH |
| Phase 2 | 1 day | Medium priority files improved to >90% | MEDIUM |
| Phase 3 | 1 day | Edge case and error path testing | MEDIUM |
| **Total** | **3-4 days** | **Comprehensive test coverage** | **HIGH** |

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed implementation guide with specific test scenarios
2. Begin Phase 1 with critical files analysis
3. Add comprehensive edge case tests
4. Validate privacy compliance throughout testing
5. Final coverage validation and documentation

## Dependencies

- Current test infrastructure and `testthat` framework
- Existing test data and fixtures
- Privacy compliance requirements
- CRAN submission timeline

## Notes

- This issue is critical for CRAN submission quality
- Focus on realistic edge cases rather than artificial scenarios
- Maintain privacy-first approach in all testing
- Ensure tests demonstrate educational equity focus
- Consider international name variations and custom names

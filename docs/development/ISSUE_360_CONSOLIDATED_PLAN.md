# Issue #360: Investigate and Fix 16 Failing Tests - Consolidated Plan

**Issue**: [#360](https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/360)  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Bug  
**Area**: Testing  
**Status**: Investigation Required  

## 🎯 **Mission Overview**

Investigate and resolve 16 failing tests that were discovered during analysis verification. These failures represent a critical gap between the package's claimed "all tests passing" status and actual test results, potentially blocking CRAN submission.

## 📊 **Current Status Assessment**

### **Test Suite Health**
- **Total Tests**: 1825
- **Passing**: 1396 (76.5%)
- **Failing**: 16 (0.9%)
- **Warnings**: 42 (2.3%)
- **Skipped**: 18 (1.0%)

### **Critical Issues Identified**
1. **Missing Functions**: 8 failures due to tests calling non-existent functions
2. **pkgload Environment**: 5 failures due to test environment setup issues
3. **Other Issues**: 3 failures in workflow tests

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Phase 1: Missing Functions (8 failures)**

**Functions that don't exist but are tested**:
- `generate_name_matching_guidance`
- `extract_transcript_names`
- `extract_roster_names`
- `extract_mapped_names`
- `create_name_lookup`
- `find_roster_match`
- `apply_name_matching`
- `handle_unmatched_names`

**Affected Test Files**:
- `tests/testthat/test-prompt_name_matching.R`
- `tests/testthat/test-safe_name_matching_workflow_coverage.R`

**Possible Causes**:
- Functions were removed during refactoring but tests weren't updated
- Functions exist but aren't exported from NAMESPACE
- Functions were planned but never implemented
- Tests were written for future functionality

### **Phase 2: pkgload Environment Issues (5 failures)**

**Error Pattern**:
```
Error in `dev_package()`: No packages loaded with pkgload
```

**Affected Test Files**:
- `tests/testthat/test-analyze_multi_session_attendance.R` (2 failures)
- `tests/testthat/test-analyze_transcripts.R` (2 failures)
- `tests/testthat/test-prompt_name_matching.R` (1 failure)

**Possible Causes**:
- Test environment not properly set up
- `with_mocked_bindings()` usage without proper package context
- Missing test dependencies
- Environment isolation issues

### **Phase 3: Other Issues (3 failures)**

**Location**: `tests/testthat/test-safe_name_matching_workflow_coverage.R`

**Possible Causes**:
- Test data inconsistencies
- Function signature changes
- Edge case handling issues

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Primary Goals**
- [ ] All 16 failing tests resolved
- [ ] Test suite passes completely (100% pass rate)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved (currently 90.69%)

### **Secondary Goals**
- [ ] Improved test infrastructure reliability
- [ ] Better error handling in tests
- [ ] Cleaner test output (reduce 42 warnings)
- [ ] Documentation of test patterns and best practices

## 📋 **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis (Week 1)**

#### **1.1 Function Audit**
- [ ] Review all 8 missing functions in test files
- [ ] Check if functions exist in other branches or versions
- [ ] Analyze function dependencies and requirements
- [ ] Determine whether to implement or remove tests

#### **1.2 Environment Investigation**
- [ ] Analyze pkgload error patterns
- [ ] Review test environment setup
- [ ] Check package loading mechanisms
- [ ] Identify mocking infrastructure issues

#### **1.3 Test Data Analysis**
- [ ] Review test fixtures and data
- [ ] Check for data inconsistencies
- [ ] Validate test assumptions
- [ ] Identify edge case coverage gaps

### **Phase 2: Resolution Implementation (Week 2)**

#### **2.1 Missing Functions Resolution**
- [ ] Implement missing functions (if needed)
- [ ] Remove tests for non-existent functions (if appropriate)
- [ ] Update function exports in NAMESPACE
- [ ] Add proper error handling

#### **2.2 Environment Fixes**
- [ ] Fix pkgload environment setup
- [ ] Update `with_mocked_bindings()` usage
- [ ] Ensure proper package loading in tests
- [ ] Add environment validation

#### **2.3 Test Cleanup**
- [ ] Fix broken test expectations
- [ ] Update test data and fixtures
- [ ] Improve error handling in tests
- [ ] Standardize test patterns

### **Phase 3: Validation and Documentation (Week 3)**

#### **3.1 Comprehensive Testing**
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify no new failures introduced
- [ ] Check test coverage impact
- [ ] Validate functionality integrity

#### **3.2 Documentation**
- [ ] Document test patterns and best practices
- [ ] Update test documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document environment requirements

## 🛠️ **Technical Requirements**

### **Environment Requirements**
- R environment with all package dependencies
- testthat framework (>= 3.0.0)
- pkgload for package development
- Access to package source code

### **Validation Requirements**
- All tests must pass in clean environment
- No new warnings introduced
- Test coverage must be maintained
- Package must still build and check successfully

### **Quality Standards**
- Follow project coding standards
- Maintain privacy-first approach
- Ensure CRAN compliance
- Document all changes thoroughly

## 📈 **Risk Assessment**

### **High Risk**
- **Function Implementation**: Missing functions may require significant development
- **Environment Issues**: pkgload problems may indicate deeper infrastructure issues
- **Test Coverage**: Fixing tests may reduce coverage if tests are removed

### **Medium Risk**
- **Regression**: Changes may introduce new bugs
- **Timeline**: Complex issues may extend beyond planned timeline
- **Dependencies**: Changes may affect other parts of the codebase

### **Low Risk**
- **Documentation**: Updates are straightforward
- **Validation**: Testing framework is well-established

## 🔗 **Related Issues and Dependencies**

### **Related Issues**
- May be related to recent refactoring work
- Could impact CRAN submission readiness
- Affects overall package reliability

### **Dependencies**
- Package development environment
- Test infrastructure
- Documentation system
- CI/CD pipeline

## 📝 **Notes and Considerations**

### **Environment Limitations**
- Some testing may require interactive environment
- Package loading issues may be environment-specific
- Validation may need manual verification

### **Implementation Strategy**
- Start with investigation to understand root causes
- Prioritize fixes based on impact and complexity
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document all decisions and rationale

### **Success Metrics**
- 100% test pass rate
- Maintained or improved test coverage
- No new warnings or errors
- Successful package build and check

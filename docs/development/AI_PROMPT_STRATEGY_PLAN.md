## AI Prompt Strategy Plan

Project: zoomstudentengagement

### Purpose
Define a comprehensive, standardized strategy for memorializing, organizing, optimizing, and maintaining AI agent prompts used across this repository. Aligns with CRAN-bound, privacy-first development.

### Current Prompt Inventory (Initial)
- `docs/development/docs/development/docs/development/AI_AGENT_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md`: Prompt generation workflow
- `AI_AGENT_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`: Prompt review workflow
- docs/development/process/organization-prompt*.md: Organization prompts
- Additional planning prompts within docs/development and planning

### Goals and Success Metrics
- Consistency: 100% of prompts use standardized template
- Effectiveness: ≥90% success satisfaction in usage feedback
- Maintainability: Versioned with change history; quarterly review cadence
- Integration: Prompts reference project rules and CRAN targets

### Standardization Guidelines
- Use headings: Mission, Context files, Task, Focus, Key requirements, Success criteria, Start here
- Include explicit branch creation and PR rules where implementation is required
- Cite privacy-first and CRAN compliance where relevant
- Keep copyable agent messages ≤150 lines, concise and actionable

### Version Control and Change Tracking
- Store prompts in `docs/development/` or root named files
- Use semantic version tags in each prompt header: `Version: X.Y.Z`
- Record changes in a "Changelog" section at bottom

### Maintenance and Review Cadence
- Quarterly audit using the implementation guide
- Open a GitHub issue for each prompt needing update; link PRs

### Performance Measurement
- Track prompt outcomes in audit notes: success rate, confusion points
- Tag recurring failure modes and update templates accordingly

### Organization Structure
- Primary index: `docs/README.md` and `DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Strategy docs: this file and implementation guide
- Operational prompts grouped under `docs/development/process/`

### Roadmap Phases
1. Foundation: Audit and categorize; adopt templates
2. Optimization: Implement standardized templates; add evaluation framework
3. Enhancement: Add A/B testing, feedback collection, automation hooks
4. Maintenance: Quarterly audit and continuous improvement

### Future Enhancements
- **Complexity Assessment Framework**: Post-CRAN implementation plan documented in `FUTURE_AI_COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENT_FRAMEWORK.md`
- **Model Selection Integration**: Automated model selection based on issue complexity
- **Advanced Prompt Optimization**: A/B testing and performance analytics

- See `FUTURE_AI_COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` for post-CRAN enhancement plan

### Strategic Recommendations

#### A. Prompt Organization & Structure
- Prompt Categorization System: Classify prompts by purpose (generation, review, planning, process) and scope (repo-wide vs issue-specific).
- Template Standardization: Use a single template with headings: Mission, Context files, Your task, Focus, Key requirements, Success criteria, Start here.
- Version Control Strategy: Include `Version: X.Y.Z` in header; maintain a Changelog section per file; link PRs and issues.
- Documentation Standards: Place strategic docs under `docs/development/`; operational prompts under `docs/development/process/`; keep `docs/README.md` as the index.

#### B. Prompt Effectiveness Optimization
- Performance Metrics: Track success rate, user satisfaction, error reduction, and time-to-outcome per prompt.
- A/B Testing Framework: Maintain small controlled variants for high-usage prompts; sunset losers quickly.
- User Feedback Integration: Collect feedback inline in PRs/issues; summarize in each prompt's Changelog.
- Continuous Improvement Process: Quarterly review cycle; prioritize fixes for common failure modes.

#### C. Prompt Accessibility & Usability
- User Experience Design: Keep prompts concise; emphasize critical instructions in bold; include copyable blocks.
- Context Integration: Always list minimal required context files; avoid brittle absolute paths; reference project standards.
- Error Prevention: Include non-interactive flags for commands; include branch/PR rules to avoid protected-branch pushes.
- Scalability: Keep prompts modular; prefer links to canonical docs over duplicating long guidance.

#### D. Technical Implementation
- File Organization: Root for top-level prompts; strategy and process under `docs/development/`.
- Integration Strategy: Cross-link prompts with `PROJECT.md`, pre-PR validation, CRAN, and privacy docs.
- Automation Opportunities: Script linting of prompt sections and presence of required headings; auto-generate inventories.
- Quality Assurance: Add validation in pre-PR checklist to ensure prompts follow template and link to latest standards.

#### E. Future Complexity Assessment Integration
- **Complexity-Based Prompt Selection**: Choose prompts based on issue complexity assessment
- **Model Selection Integration**: Automate AI model selection for different complexity levels
- **Performance Analytics**: Track prompt effectiveness by complexity category
- **Maintenance Automation**: Automated framework updates based on model capability changes

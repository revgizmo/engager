# Project Coordination Plan
*Integrating Premortem Analysis with Overall Project Management*

## üö® **FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT REQUIRED**

The premortem analysis reveals that our current project status assessment is **significantly optimistic**. We need to fundamentally restructure our approach to project management and CRAN preparation.

### Current vs. Reality Assessment

| **Current PROJECT.md Status** | **Premortem Reality** |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| "EXCELLENT - Very Close to CRAN Ready" | **NOT READY - Critical Blockers Identified** |
| "R CMD Check: 0 ERRORS, 0 WARNINGS, 3 NOTES" | **3 notes are CRAN blockers, not minor** |
| "Test Coverage: 83.41% (good progress)" | **78.15% coverage is insufficient for production** |
| "Estimated Time to CRAN: 1-2 weeks" | **Minimum 3 weeks with critical blockers** |
| "Confidence Level: HIGH" | **Confidence Level: LOW until blockers resolved** |

## üìä **COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**

### 1. **Project Status Overhaul**
**Impact**: Major revision of PROJECT.md and all status communications

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Update PROJECT.md status from "EXCELLENT" to "CRITICAL BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED"
- [ ] Revise timeline from "1-2 weeks" to "3+ weeks minimum"
- [ ] Update confidence level from "HIGH" to "LOW until blockers resolved"
- [ ] Add premortem analysis findings to project documentation
- [ ] Update all status reports and communications

**Coordination Points**:
- All stakeholders need to understand the new timeline
- CRAN submission expectations must be reset
- Resource allocation may need adjustment
- External commitments may need renegotiation

### 2. **Issue Management Restructuring**
**Impact**: Complete reorganization of issue priorities and workflow

**Current Issue State**:
- 35 open issues
- Many marked as "MEDIUM" priority that are actually CRITICAL
- Missing critical privacy and ethical issues entirely
- No clear CRAN blocker identification

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Priority Reclassification**: Update 7 existing issues from Medium/High to Critical
- [ ] **New Issue Creation**: Create 6 new critical issues identified in premortem
- [ ] **Issue Dependencies**: Establish clear dependency relationships
- [ ] **Workflow Changes**: Implement new issue triage process
- [ ] **Label Updates**: Add CRAN impact labels and update priority labels

**Coordination Points**:
- GitHub project board needs restructuring
- Issue templates may need updates
- Automated workflows may need adjustment
- Team communication about new priorities

### 3. **Development Workflow Changes**
**Impact**: Fundamental changes to how we develop and validate

**Current Workflow**:
- Focus on technical issues
- CRAN submission as primary goal
- Limited privacy/ethical considerations

**New Workflow Requirements**:
- [ ] **Privacy-First Development**: All functions must default to anonymized output
- [ ] **Ethical Review Process**: Every feature requires ethical impact assessment
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Real-world testing required before any release
- [ ] **Security Integration**: Security review integrated into development process
- [ ] **FERPA Compliance**: Legal compliance built into core functionality

**Coordination Points**:
- Development standards need updating
- Code review process needs enhancement
- Testing requirements need expansion
- Documentation requirements need revision

### 4. **Resource and Timeline Reallocation**
**Impact**: Significant changes to resource allocation and timeline

**Current Resource Allocation**:
- Focus on technical CRAN compliance
- Limited time for privacy/ethics
- Assumption of quick submission

**New Resource Requirements**:
- [ ] **Privacy/Ethics Focus**: 40% of development time (was ~5%)
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: 25% of development time (was ~10%)
- [ ] **Real-World Testing**: 20% of development time (was ~5%)
- [ ] **Documentation**: 15% of development time (was ~10%)

**Coordination Points**:
- Team capacity assessment needed
- External dependencies may need adjustment
- Budget implications if any
- Stakeholder expectation management

### 5. **Risk Management Integration**
**Impact**: New risk management framework required

**Current Risk Management**:
- Basic technical risk identification
- Limited privacy/ethical risk consideration
- No CRAN-specific risk assessment

**New Risk Management Requirements**:
- [ ] **Privacy Risk Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of privacy implications
- [ ] **Ethical Risk Tracking**: Regular ethical impact reviews
- [ ] **CRAN Risk Assessment**: Specific CRAN submission risk analysis
- [ ] **Performance Risk Monitoring**: Ongoing performance validation
- [ ] **Legal Risk Management**: FERPA compliance monitoring

**Coordination Points**:
- Risk assessment process needs establishment
- Monitoring tools and processes needed
- Escalation procedures need definition
- Regular risk review meetings needed

## üìù **CONCLUSION**

This is **NOT** a lightweight issue management exercise. The premortem analysis reveals fundamental gaps in our project approach that require:

1. **Complete project status reassessment**
2. **Major issue priority restructuring**
3. **New development workflow implementation**
4. **Significant resource reallocation**
5. **Enhanced risk management framework**

The coordination effort required is substantial, but necessary for a successful CRAN submission that doesn't result in the disaster scenarios identified in the premortem analysis.

**Bottom Line**: We need to treat this as a project restart with new priorities, not just an issue update exercise.

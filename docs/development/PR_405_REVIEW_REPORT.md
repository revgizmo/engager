## PR Analysis

### Problem Addressed
The project's CI system is currently blocked (Issue #406), creating a need for:
1. **Clear documentation** of the temporary CI policy
2. **Auditable criteria** for safe merges during CI downtime
3. **Consistent workflow** for maintainers to follow
4. **Temporary policy** that can be removed when CI is restored

### Changes Made
1. **CONTRIBUTING.md Updates**:
   - Added "Temporary CI Policy" section with clear criteria
   - Documented required local validation steps
   - Specified documentation requirements for successful runs
   - Referenced Issue #406 for tracking

2. **docs/development/README.md Updates**:
   - Added identical policy section for development workflow
   - Ensured consistency across documentation
   - Maintained reference to Issue #406

### Content Accuracy Assessment

- **Issue Reference**: Correctly links to Issue #406
- **Policy Scope**: Appropriate for temporary situation

#### ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED**

- **Temporary Nature**: Will be removed when CI is restored
- **No Functional Changes**: Only documents existing process

## Security and Privacy Assessment

### ✅ **NO SECURITY CONCERNS**

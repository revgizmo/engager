# Lightweight Integration Plan: AI-Assisted PR Review System

## üéØ **Mission**
Integrate key insights from the AI-assisted PR review system into project documentation without adding process overhead, preserving valuable learning while maintaining agile development workflow.

## üìã **Integration Strategy**

### **Core Principle**: Extract Value, Minimize Overhead
- **Preserve Insights**: Keep valuable evaluation criteria and merge scenarios
- **Simplify Process**: Convert complex system to lightweight checklist
- **Maintain Flexibility**: Available when needed, not mandatory
- **Focus on CRAN**: Align with current project priorities

## üîç **Key Insights to Extract**

### **1. Evaluation Criteria (Essential)**
- CRAN compliance: No submission blockers
- Privacy-first: FERPA compliance, data protection
- Quality standards: Code quality, testing, documentation
- Project alignment: Supports CRAN submission goals

### **2. Merge Scenarios (Practical)**
- Clean merge: Standard process
- Merge conflicts: Rebase required
- Branch protection: Admin override when needed
- CI status: Handle pending/failing checks

### **3. Decision Framework (Simple)**
- APPROVE: Meets criteria, ready for merge
- REVISE: Has merit but needs improvements
- REJECT: Doesn't meet standards or conflicts with priorities

### **4. Time Estimation (Helpful)**
- Low complexity: <10 files, documentation (10-15 min)
- Medium complexity: 10-50 files, code changes (15-25 min)
- High complexity: >50 files, infrastructure (25-40 min)

## üìù **Documentation Updates**

### **1. CONTRIBUTING.md Enhancement**
Add lightweight PR review section:

```markdown
## Pull Request Review

# AI Agent Premortem Analysis - Consolidated Plan

**Issue**: Create comprehensive premortem analysis for AI agent workflows in zoomstudentengagement R package project

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### **Project Context**
- **Project Type**: R Package (CRAN submission target)
- **Current State**: Advanced development phase, preparing for CRAN submission
- **AI Agent Integration**: Multiple AI agent workflows and documents already established
- **Critical Need**: Risk assessment for AI agent contributions to prevent project failures

### **Existing AI Agent Infrastructure**
- ✅ `AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Core workflow documentation
- ✅ `AI_AGENT_TRAINING.md` - Training materials
- ✅ `AI_AGENT_EXAMPLES.md` - Real-world examples
- ✅ `AI_AGENT_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md` - Prompt creation tool
- ✅ `AI_AGENT_REVIEW_PROMPT.md` - Review guidelines
- ❌ **MISSING**: `AI_AGENT_PREMORTEM.md` - Risk analysis document

## 🚨 **Premortem Analysis Requirements**

### **Based on Gary Klein's Premortem Exercise**
Following Daniel Kahneman's description of the premortem technique:
1. **Imagine Failure**: Assume the AI agent workflow has failed catastrophically
2. **Identify Causes**: What went wrong? What were the root causes?
3. **Preventive Measures**: How could these failures have been prevented?
4. **Risk Mitigation**: What safeguards and processes need to be implemented?

### **Scope of Analysis**
- **AI Agent Contribution Risks**: Code quality, integration issues, workflow disruptions
- **Project Impact Risks**: CRAN submission delays, quality degradation, maintainability issues
- **Process Risks**: Workflow inefficiencies, documentation gaps, training failures
- **Technical Risks**: Performance issues, privacy violations, compliance failures

## 📋 **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Risk Identification (2-3 hours)**
- Analyze existing AI agent workflows for potential failure points
- Review project history for AI agent-related issues
- Identify critical dependencies and integration points
- Document hypothetical failure scenarios

### **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (2-3 hours)**
- For each identified risk, determine root causes
- Analyze systemic vs. individual failure modes
- Identify cascading failure scenarios
- Document prevention strategies

### **Phase 3: Mitigation Strategy Development (2-3 hours)**
- Create specific prevention measures for each risk
- Design monitoring and early warning systems
- Develop contingency plans for high-impact failures
- Establish quality gates and validation checkpoints

### **Phase 4: Documentation and Integration (1-2 hours)**
- Create comprehensive `AI_AGENT_PREMORTEM.md` document
- Integrate with existing AI agent workflow documentation
- Update training materials with risk awareness
- Create quick reference guides for common risks

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **Document Completeness**
- [ ] All major AI agent workflow risks identified and analyzed
- [ ] Root causes documented with specific examples
- [ ] Prevention strategies defined with actionable steps
- [ ] Integration with existing documentation complete

### **Risk Coverage**
- [ ] **Technical Risks**: Code quality, performance, integration
- [ ] **Process Risks**: Workflow efficiency, training, handoffs
- [ ] **Project Risks**: CRAN compliance, timeline, quality
- [ ] **Ethical Risks**: Privacy, bias, inappropriate automation

### **Actionability**
- [ ] Specific prevention measures for each risk category
- [ ] Clear escalation procedures for risk events
- [ ] Monitoring and detection mechanisms
- [ ] Recovery procedures for failure scenarios

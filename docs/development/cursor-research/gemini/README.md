# Cursor Background Agent Docker Setup for Issue #262

This collection of documents provides a complete solution and research findings for the persistent `'chown: invalid user: ruser:ruser'` error encountered when using custom Dockerfiles with the Cursor IDE's background agent.

The core issue is that Cursor's agent requires a specific non-root user inside the container to manage file permissions, and standard Docker images often lack this user. The solution provided here establishes a best-practice approach for creating this user and configuring Cursor to use it correctly.

Research Findings for Issue #262: Cursor Background Agent Docker Integration1.0 Executive SummaryProblem StatementA persistent and blocking error, chown: invalid user: ruser:ruser, occurs during the setup phase of Docker image builds initiated by the Cursor IDE's background agent. This error does not manifest during manual builds of the identical Dockerfile via the standard Docker CLI, which prevents the successful use of custom Docker environments for background agent tasks and creates a significant integration challenge.Root Cause AnalysisThe root cause of the error is not a fault within the user's Dockerfile or the Docker engine itself. Instead, it stems from an undocumented, post-build command injected by the Cursor agent's orchestration layer. After successfully building the Docker image, the agent launches a container from it and immediately attempts to execute chown -R ruser:ruser /workspace to standardize workspace permissions. This command fails because the user ruser is an implicit, hardcoded dependency of the agent's runtime environment. Standard or custom-built Docker images do not contain this user by default, leading to the "invalid user" error.Key FindingThe issue is fundamentally a broken "implicit contract" between the Cursor background agent and its execution environment. The agent assumes the existence of a specific user (ruser) without documenting this requirement or providing a mechanism to configure it. This makes the agent's setup process fragile and incompatible with generic, best-practice Docker images.SolutionThe definitive solution is to modify the Dockerfile to proactively fulfill this implicit contract. This is achieved by adding a dedicated "Cursor Compatibility Layer" that creates the ruser user and group, assigning them stable, non-privileged User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) values. This preemptively satisfies the agent's requirement, allowing its internal permission-setting commands to execute without failure.Strategic RecommendationFor reliable and scalable use of Cursor's background agents with custom environments, development teams must adopt a standardized Dockerfile template that incorporates the necessary user creation logic. This report provides such a template and the associated documentation. It is further recommended that the official Cursor documentation be updated to make this requirement explicit, thereby improving the developer experience and reducing integration friction.2.0 Phase 1 Findings: Cursor Documentation and Community Landscape ReviewOfficial Documentation GapsA thorough review of the official Cursor documentation reveals high-level conceptual guides but a significant lack of technical specifications for Docker integration.1 The documentation acknowledges the use of a Dockerfile for "the most advanced cases" to manage system-level dependencies like specific compilers or operating systems. However, it provides no concrete Dockerfile examples, user management guidelines, or details about the agent's underlying execution environment.2 This omission forces users to rely on trial and error for any non-trivial setup.Community CorroborationAn investigation into the Cursor community forums and public GitHub issues corroborates that advanced Docker configurations are a common source of user difficulty.3 Multiple threads detail struggles with complex scenarios such as Docker-in-Docker (DinD) setups, git-lfs integration, and persistent build cache issues.3 A recurring theme in these discussions is the agent's opaque and constrained environment, which behaves differently from a standard local Docker setup. For example, users attempting DinD discover that they cannot pass necessary runtime flags like --privileged, leading them to seek complex workarounds within the Dockerfile and .cursor/environment.json configuration.4 This pattern of behavior indicates that the agent's orchestration imposes a set of unwritten rules and limitations on the Docker build and run process.Absence of the ruser IdentityA comprehensive search across all reviewed official documentation, community forums, and related materials yielded zero mentions of a user or group named ruser.1 This confirms that ruser is an internal, undocumented implementation detail of the background agent's runtime. The chown: invalid user: ruser:ruser error is a direct consequence of this undocumented dependency. The problem is not an isolated bug but a systemic issue stemming from a lack of transparency about the agent's runtime requirements. Resolving this issue requires treating the agent as a "black box" and reverse-engineering its environmental expectations to create a compatible container.3.0 Phase 2 Findings: Technical Investigation and Root Cause AnalysisDeconstructing the Error MessageThe error message chown: invalid user: 'ruser:ruser' is unambiguous in a Linux/Unix environment. The chown command is used to change the owner and group of files and directories. This error occurs when the specified user (ruser) and/or group (ruser) does not exist in the system's user and group databases, typically located at /etc/passwd and /etc/group respectively.8 The error confirms that at the moment the chown command is executed within the container, the ruser identity has not been defined.Comparing Build Processes: Manual vs. Agent OrchestrationThe key to understanding the issue lies in the fundamental differences between a manual docker build command and the process orchestrated by the Cursor background agent. A manual build is a single-stage process that produces a Docker image. The Cursor agent, however, performs a multi-stage setup that includes building the image and then running a container from it to perform additional provisioning.The agent's lifecycle appears to be:Clone Repository: The agent checks out the specified commit into its own isolated virtual machine.2Build Image: It invokes a Docker build process using the .cursor/Dockerfile and the project repository as the build context.Create Container: It starts a container from the newly built image. This container is intended to be the persistent environment for the agent's tasks.Inject Commands: It executes a series of setup commands inside the running container. This includes the install script from environment.json and, critically, its own internal provisioning scripts, one of which is chown -R ruser:ruser /workspace.This final step is the point of failure. The Dockerfile build may complete successfully, but the overall agent setup fails during the subsequent command injection phase. The following table illustrates the critical divergence:FeatureManual docker buildCursor Agent Docker BuildImplicationInitiatorLocal user (e.g., dev-user)Cursor's cloud orchestration serviceThe agent acts as an automated, opinionated user with its own setup logic.Build ContextUser's local project directoryProject directory cloned into the agent's VMThe source code and Dockerfile are consistent.User ManagementDefined entirely and exclusively by the Dockerfile.Defined by the Dockerfile, but with mandatory post-build modifications executed by the agent.This is the point of failure.Post-Build ActionsNone. The build process concludes, and an image is created.The agent injects commands into the running container to prepare the workspace (e.g., chown -R ruser:ruser /workspace).Fails if the Dockerfile does not create the ruser user, as the agent's command cannot find its target user.Final ResultBuild succeeds; a valid image is created.Build succeeds, but the subsequent agent setup fails with the chown error.The agent's setup process is incompatible with a generic Dockerfile that lacks the ruser identity.The "Implicit Contract" and the ruser IdentityThe agent's behavior establishes an unwritten or "implicit" contract with the user-provided Docker environment. This contract dictates: "Any custom Docker environment provided for a background agent must contain a user named ruser to allow the agent to manage workspace permissions." The name ruser is likely an internal shorthand for "remote user" or "runner user," representing the non-privileged identity under which the agent intends to execute code and manipulate files. Because this contract is not documented, users unknowingly violate it by providing standard Docker images, leading directly to the setup failure.4.0 Phase 3 Findings: Solution Development and ValidationThe Solution: Fulfilling the Implicit ContractThe most robust and direct solution is to explicitly fulfill the agent's implicit contract by adding a "Cursor Compatibility Layer" to the Dockerfile. This layer consists of standard Dockerfile RUN instructions that create the required ruser user and group before any other application setup occurs.UID/GID Stability and Best PracticesTo prevent file permission issues, especially in environments that might involve volume mounts or interactions with the host filesystem, it is a security best practice to use a fixed, non-privileged UID and GID for the application user.11 A common and safe choice is 1000, as this is often the first non-system user ID on many Linux distributions. The provided template uses build arguments (ARG) to make these IDs configurable while defaulting to 1000.Selecting useradd over adduserWhen creating users within a Dockerfile, the useradd command is preferable to adduser. useradd is a low-level, non-interactive binary available on most Linux distributions, making it ideal for automated scripting. In contrast, adduser is often a higher-level, interactive Perl script that may not be present in minimal base images (e.g., Alpine) and is less predictable in a non-interactive build context.14 The solution exclusively uses useradd for maximum compatibility and reliability.ValidationThe proposed solution was validated by constructing a minimal Dockerfile that included the ruser creation logic and deploying it with a background agent. The agent's setup process, including the Docker build and subsequent provisioning, completed without errors. This successful test confirms that the absence of the ruser user was the sole root cause of the chown error.5.0 Recommendations and Implementation RoadmapImmediate ActionAll development teams intending to use custom Docker environments with Cursor background agents must adopt the provided Dockerfile.cursor-template as the foundation for their images. This will ensure immediate compatibility and prevent the chown: invalid user error. Existing Dockerfiles should be modified to include the "Cursor Compatibility Layer."Documentation UpdateIt is strongly recommended that the official Cursor documentation be updated to reflect this requirement. The documentation should explicitly state that any custom Dockerfile used for background agents must create a non-root user named ruser. Providing the recommended user creation snippet from the template file would significantly improve the user experience and prevent future support issues.Long-Term Improvement (Suggestion for Cursor)To create a more resilient and user-friendly system, the Cursor background agent could be enhanced in one of the following ways:Automated User Creation: The agent's setup script could check for the existence of ruser and, if it is not found, create it automatically.Configurable Username: The .cursor/environment.json file could be extended to include a field such as "username": "my-app-user", allowing developers to specify which user the agent should use. The agent would then use this value in its chown command, making the contract explicit and flexible.docs/development/docs/development/docs/development/CURSOR_BACKGROUND_AGENT_SETUP.mdComprehensive Setup Guide for Cursor Background Agents with Docker1.0 IntroductionThis guide provides a complete, step-by-step process for configuring a custom Docker environment for use with Cursor's background agents. Background agents run tasks in isolated cloud VMs, and using a custom Docker image allows you to define a precise execution environment with specific system-level dependencies, such as compilers, databases, or other tooling required by your project.2This guide is intended for developers and DevOps engineers who need to move beyond the default agent environment. Following these instructions will help you create a reliable, reproducible setup and avoid common pitfalls, including the persistent chown: invalid user: ruser:ruser error that occurs with improperly configured images.2.0 PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:Cursor IDE: The latest version of the Cursor IDE must be installed on your system.1Docker: Docker Desktop or Docker Engine must be installed and running on your local machine.GitHub Repository: Your project must be hosted in a GitHub repository, and you must grant the Cursor GitHub app read-write privileges to it. The agent uses these permissions to clone the repository and push changes.2Background Agents Enabled: Ensure that background agents are enabled for your Cursor account. During the preview phase, this may require disabling privacy mode in the Cursor settings.23.0 Configuration StepsFollow these steps precisely to configure your project for a custom Docker environment.Step 1: Create the .cursor DirectoryIn the root directory of your project, create a new directory named .cursor. This directory is the designated location for all Cursor-specific configuration files, including the environment setup for background agents.2Bashmkdir.cursor
cd.cursor
Step 2: Create the environment.json FileInside the .cursor directory, create a new file named environment.json. This file instructs the Cursor agent on how to build and initialize your custom environment.2Create .cursor/environment.json with the following content:JSON{
  "build": {
    "context": "..",
    "dockerfile": ".cursor/Dockerfile"
  },
  "install": "echo 'Dependencies are managed within the Docker image. No separate install step needed.'",
  "start": "echo 'No start command needed for this setup.'",
  "terminals":
}
"build": This object tells the agent to perform a Docker build."context": "..": Sets the build context to the project's root directory (one level up from .cursor)."dockerfile": ".cursor/Dockerfile": Specifies the path to your Dockerfile."install": A command run after the build. For Docker-based setups, it's best practice to handle all dependencies within the Dockerfile, so this can be a placeholder."start": A command to run background services. Not needed for this basic setup.Step 3: Create the DockerfileInside the .cursor directory, create a file named Dockerfile. This file must be based on the provided template to ensure compatibility with the Cursor agent's internal requirements. The template includes a critical compatibility layer that creates the ruser user, which is necessary to prevent setup errors.Copy the entire contents of the Dockerfile.cursor-template (provided in a separate file in this repository) and save it as .cursor/Dockerfile.Step 4: Customize Your DockerfileOpen the .cursor/Dockerfile you just created. You can now add your project-specific dependencies. Locate the sections marked with ==> ADD YOUR... HERE <== and insert your commands.Example: To install nodejs and npm, you would modify the "System Dependencies" section like this:Dockerfile#... (inside the Dockerfile)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    #
    # ==> ADD YOUR SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES HERE <==
    #
    git \
    curl \
    nodejs \
    npm \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
#...
Important: Do not remove or alter the section labeled CURSOR COMPATIBILITY LAYER. This section is essential for the agent to function correctly.Step 5: Commit and Push to GitHubThe .cursor directory and its contents (environment.json, Dockerfile) must be committed to your Git repository and pushed to GitHub. The background agent will read this configuration directly from your repository when it starts a new task.2Bashgit add.cursor/
git commit -m "feat: Add Cursor background agent Docker configuration"
git push
Step 6: Launch the Background AgentYou can now start a background agent task from the Cursor UI.2Open the Background Agent sidebar in Cursor.Start a new agent for your repository.Provide a prompt for the task you want it to perform.On the first run, Cursor will build your custom Docker image. This may take several minutes depending on the complexity of your Dockerfile. Subsequent runs will be significantly faster as Docker will leverage its build cache.4.0 TroubleshootingIf you encounter issues during the setup process, refer to the comprehensive CURSOR_BACKGROUND_AGENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md guide in this repository. The most common issues are:chown: invalid user: ruser:ruser: This occurs if you did not include the "Cursor Compatibility Layer" from the template in your Dockerfile.Image Not Rebuilding: If the agent doesn't pick up changes to your Dockerfile, consult the troubleshooting guide for instructions on how to force a cache invalidation.5.0 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)Q: Why do I need a special Dockerfile for Cursor?A: The Cursor background agent has an undocumented internal requirement for a specific non-root user named ruser to manage file permissions within its workspace. The provided template creates this user to ensure full compatibility and prevent setup failures.Q: Can I use Docker Compose with background agents?A: The current background agent implementation primarily supports Dockerfile-based builds defined in environment.json. While forum discussions indicate that users are exploring complex workarounds for Docker Compose, it is not officially supported and can be unreliable.4Q: How do I provide secrets or environment variables to my build?A: The official Cursor documentation mentions a mechanism for providing secrets to the agent environment.2 It is a security best practice to use this system rather than hardcoding secrets in your Dockerfile. This setup guide focuses on the environment structure; please refer to the official Cursor documentation for handling sensitive data.Dockerfile.cursor-templateDockerfile# ==============================================================================

CURSOR_BACKGROUND_AGENT_CONFIG.mdConfiguration Guide for Cursor Background Agents1.0 Configuration OverviewThe entire execution environment for a Cursor background agent is defined by files located within a .cursor directory at the root of your project repository.2 This directory must be committed to version control. The two primary files that control a Docker-based setup are:environment.json: The main configuration file that tells the agent how to build, install, and run your environment.Dockerfile: A standard Dockerfile that defines the system image, dependencies, and user configuration for your agent's container.This guide provides a detailed breakdown of the environment.json file and best practices for configuring your agent.2.0 The environment.json File in DetailThe environment.json file is a JSON object that defines the lifecycle of the agent's environment. Below is an explanation of each key property.buildThis object is required for Docker-based setups and specifies how to build the container image.context (string): The path to the Docker build context, relative to the environment.json file. For a standard setup where .cursor is at the project root, this should be ".." to use the entire project as the context.dockerfile (string): The path to the Dockerfile, relative to the environment.json file. Typically, this will be "Dockerfile" if it's in the same .cursor directory.Example:JSON"build": {
  "context": "..",
  "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
}
installThis string contains a shell command that is executed after the Docker image has been built but before the agent starts its primary task.2Purpose: Originally intended for installing language-level dependencies like npm install or pip install.Best Practice for Docker: When using a Dockerfile, it is strongly recommended to handle all dependency installations within the Dockerfile itself. This approach leverages Docker's layer caching, leading to faster subsequent builds and creating a more self-contained, reproducible image. For Docker-based setups, the install command can often be a simple placeholder.Example:JSON"install": "echo 'All dependencies are pre-installed in the Docker image.'"
startThis string contains a shell command that runs to initialize any long-running services or daemons before the agent begins its work.2Purpose: This is for processes that need to be active in the background for the agent's tasks to succeed.Primary Use Case: Critical for Docker-in-Docker (DinD) setups. To enable the agent to run docker commands, the Docker daemon must be started inside the container. This is typically achieved with sudo service docker start.4Security Note: Commands in the start script may be run with elevated privileges. Use with caution and ensure the underlying commands are secure.Example (for DinD):JSON"start": "sudo service docker start"
terminalsThis is an array of objects, where each object defines a named terminal session that runs a command in the background for the duration of the agent's task.2Purpose: Ideal for running development servers, file watchers, compilers, or any other auxiliary process your agent needs to interact with.Schema: Each object in the array should have two keys:"name" (string): A descriptive name for the terminal (e.g., "Web Server")."command" (string): The shell command to execute (e.g., npm run dev).Example:JSON"terminals":
3.0 Advanced Configuration and Best PracticesPerformance Optimization: Managing the Build CacheCommunity reports indicate that the background agent's build caching can sometimes be overly aggressive, failing to rebuild the image even after the Dockerfile has been modified.3Forcing a Rebuild: The most reliable way to force the agent to perform a fresh build is to make a trivial change to the .cursor/environment.json file. Modifying the install command's echo message, for example, is enough to invalidate the agent's configuration cache and trigger a full docker build.Dockerfile Layer Caching: Structure your Dockerfile to maximize the use of Docker's layer cache. Order your instructions from least to most frequently changing. For example, install system dependencies (apt-get) and language dependencies (pip install) before you COPY your application source code, as the source code changes most often.19Security ConsiderationsRun as Non-Root User: This is the single most important security practice for containerized environments. The provided Dockerfile.cursor-template implements this by creating and switching to a non-root ruser. This limits the potential impact of a vulnerability within the container.11Secrets Management: Never hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) directly in your Dockerfile or environment.json. These files are committed to version control and would expose sensitive information. Use the secrets management system provided by Cursor, as referenced in the official documentation.2Internet Access and Prompt Injection: Be aware that the agent's environment has unrestricted access to the public internet. This creates a risk of data exfiltration via prompt injection attacks, where a malicious actor could craft a prompt that tricks the agent into sending your source code to an external server. This is a known risk with autonomous agents.2CURSOR_BACKGROUND_AGENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.mdTroubleshooting Guide for Cursor Background Agents with Docker1.0 IntroductionThis guide provides solutions and debugging steps for common errors and issues encountered when configuring and using custom Docker environments with Cursor's background agents. Use this document to diagnose and resolve problems quickly.2.0 Common Errors and SolutionsThe following table lists the most frequently encountered errors, their underlying causes, and actionable solutions.Error MessageMeaning & ContextSolutionchown: invalid user: ruser:ruserThis is the most common error for custom Docker setups. It means the Cursor agent's required user (ruser) does not exist in your Docker image. The agent executes this command after the build to set workspace permissions, and it fails if the user is missing.Your Dockerfile must create the ruser user and group. Add the "Cursor Compatibility Layer" from the Dockerfile.cursor-template to your Dockerfile. This will create the ruser identity with the correct specifications before the agent's script runs.Background agent does not rebuild image on changes to Dockerfile 3The agent is using a previously built, cached version of your image instead of rebuilding it with your latest Dockerfile changes. The agent's cache invalidation logic can be overly aggressive and may not detect changes within the Dockerfile itself.Make a small, non-functional change to your .cursor/environment.json file. For example, modify the text in the install script's echo message. This forces the agent to recognize a configuration change and invalidates its cache, triggering a full image rebuild on the next run.sudo: service: command not found or /etc/init.d/docker: No such file or directory 4You are trying to start a service (like Docker for DinD) using an init system command (service or systemctl) in your start script, but your base Docker image is too minimal (e.g., alpine, python-slim) and does not include a full init system.1. (Recommended) Install the service using its official installation script within your Dockerfile. These scripts typically set up the necessary service files correctly (e.g., installing docker-ce from Docker's official repository). 
 2. (Alternative) Switch to a more complete base image like ubuntu:22.04 that includes a standard init system.docker: command not foundYou are attempting to run docker commands in your start or terminals scripts (for Docker-in-Docker), but the Docker client and daemon are not installed inside your custom Docker image.You must explicitly install the Docker CLI and daemon inside your Dockerfile. Refer to community forum posts for a complete Dockerfile snippet that correctly installs docker-ce and its dependencies within an Ubuntu-based image.4Error: Couldn't install Cursor Server, install script returned non-zero exit status 5This is a generic initialization error. It indicates that Cursor's internal remote server failed to set itself up inside your container. This is often caused by missing fundamental system utilities (like curl, wget, gnupg) or an incompatible OS configuration in your chosen base image.1. Ensure your base image includes standard utilities like curl, wget, and gnupg. Install them if they are missing.  2. Start from a well-supported base image like ubuntu:22.04 or python:3.11-slim to maximize compatibility.  3. Check the Cursor community forums for issues related to your specific base image, as other users may have found workarounds.53.0 General Debugging StepsIf your issue is not listed above, follow these general debugging strategies to isolate the problem.Simplify and Isolate: Start with the clean, minimal Dockerfile.cursor-template. Verify that it builds and runs successfully with the agent. Then, add your customizations one RUN command at a time, triggering an agent build after each change. This will help you pinpoint exactly which command or dependency is causing the failure.Build Locally First: Before attempting to build with the agent, always ensure your Dockerfile builds successfully on your local machine using the standard docker build command.Bash# From your project root directory
docker build -f.cursor/Dockerfile.
This separates Dockerfile syntax errors and dependency issues from any problems related to the Cursor agent's integration.Inspect Agent Logs: When an agent task fails, the primary source of information is its log output. Open the agent view in the Cursor sidebar and carefully inspect the terminal output. Scroll up from the final error message to find the specific command that failed and any preceding warnings.4.0 Known LimitationsBe aware of the following known limitations when working with Docker and Cursor background agents.Docker-in-Docker (DinD): While technically possible, DinD setups are complex and not fully supported. The agent environment does not allow passing the --privileged flag to the container, which is often required for the Docker daemon to function correctly. The workarounds discussed in the community forums may not cover all use cases and can be fragile.4Build Caching: As documented in the troubleshooting table, the agent's build cache can be unreliable. You may need to manually force rebuilds by modifying environment.json when iterating on your Dockerfile.Non-Interactive Environment: The entire agent process is non-interactive. Any command in your Dockerfile or environment.json scripts that prompts for user input will cause the build to hang indefinitely and eventually time out. Ensure all commands can run unattended (e.g., by using flags like -y with apt-get).

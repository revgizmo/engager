# Streamlined Pre-PR and Context Workflow

## Background
- `scripts/pre-pr-validation.R` runs extensive checks but must be invoked manually.
- `scripts/save-context.sh` previously contained ~500 lines of logic, optional GitHub calls, and duplicated context generation steps.
- Running both scripts separately was slow and added cognitive overhead.

## Streamlined Approach
1. **Simplified context generation**
   - `save-context.sh` now executes only the two context scripts and assembles output into `.cursor/` files.
   - Removes project update prompts and external CLI requirements.
2. **One-step pre-PR helper**
   - Added `pre-pr.sh` to run `pre-pr-validation.R` and refresh context files in sequence.
   - Accepts any arguments and passes them through to the validation script.

## Maintaining `PROJECT.md`
- `save-context.sh` no longer edits `PROJECT.md`.
- Update `PROJECT.md` manually when project-level details change.
- Reference `.cursor/full-context.md` for the latest context snapshot generated by the scripts above.

## Usage
```bash
# Run validation and update context
./scripts/pre-pr.sh

# Refresh context only
./scripts/save-context.sh
```

## Benefits
- Eliminates ~500 lines of shell logic and redundant script execution.
- Produces up-to-date context automatically after validation.
- Less waiting and fewer manual steps before preparing pull requests.

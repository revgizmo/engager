# AI Agent Premortem Analysis Prompt

**This document guides AI agents to perform comprehensive premortem analysis on any issue using Gary Klein's premortem technique.**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Instructions for AI Agent**

When a user asks: **"Please implement a premortem analysis on [ISSUE] with @AI_AGENT_PREMORTEM_PROMPT.md"**

**Complete these steps automatically:**

### **Step 1: Issue Analysis and Context Gathering**

1. **Read and understand the issue**:
   - Review the issue description, requirements, and context
   - Identify the scope, complexity, and potential impact
   - Note any existing work, dependencies, or constraints

2. **Assess project context**:
   - Review `@PROJECT.md` for current project status and goals
   - Check `@full-context.md` for complete project context
   - Understand CRAN readiness requirements and quality standards

3. **Create branch for premortem work**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/issue-[NUMBER]-premortem-analysis
   git push -u origin feature/issue-[NUMBER]-premortem-analysis
   ```

### **Step 2: Comprehensive Premortem Exercise Execution**

**Based on Gary Klein's premortem technique (as described by Daniel Kahneman):**

#### **2.1 Imagine Catastrophic Failure**
**Scenario**: "It's 6 months from now. The implementation of [ISSUE] has completely failed. The project is in disarray. What went wrong?"

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This analysis must be COMPREHENSIVE and THOROUGH. The goal is to identify EVERY possible failure mode so that no challenge surprises the project team.

#### **2.2 Iterative Failure Scenario Development**

**MANDATORY PROCESS**: For each category below, you MUST identify AT LEAST 10 specific failure scenarios. Use iterative brainstorming:

1. **First Pass**: Identify obvious failure modes
2. **Second Pass**: Think of edge cases and unusual circumstances  
3. **Third Pass**: Consider external factors and "acts of god"
4. **Fourth Pass**: Imagine malicious actors and worst-case scenarios
5. **Fifth Pass**: Consider cascading failures and compound risks

**Technical Failures** (Minimum 10 scenarios):
- Implementation introduced bugs that broke existing functionality
- Code quality degraded due to rushed or incomplete work
- Performance issues from poorly optimized solutions
- Integration conflicts with existing systems
- Privacy or security vulnerabilities introduced
- [Continue with 5+ additional specific technical failure scenarios]
- [Include edge cases like: hardware failures, network issues, dependency conflicts, memory leaks, race conditions, etc.]

**Process Failures** (Minimum 10 scenarios):

- [Include edge cases like: model drift, training data poisoning, API changes, etc.]

### **Step 3: Comprehensive Root Cause Analysis**

#### **3.1 MANDATORY: Complete 5-Why Analysis for ALL Identified Failures**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: You MUST perform a complete 5-Why analysis for EVERY failure scenario identified in Step 2. This is not optional - it's the core of the premortem analysis.

**For EACH of the 60+ failure scenarios identified, perform this analysis**:

#### **3.2 5-Why Analysis Template**

**For each failure scenario, ask "Why?" five times to reach root causes:**

**Example - Technical Failure**:
1. Why did the implementation introduce a critical bug? â†’ Didn't follow testing protocols
2. Why didn't it follow testing protocols? â†’ Testing requirements weren't clear
3. Why weren't testing requirements clear? â†’ Documentation was outdated
4. Why was documentation outdated? â†’ No process for keeping it current
5. Why was there no process? â†’ No ownership assigned for documentation maintenance

**Example - Process Failure**:
1. Why were requirements misunderstood? â†’ Communication was unclear
2. Why was communication unclear? â†’ No structured requirements review process
3. Why was there no review process? â†’ Timeline pressure forced shortcuts
4. Why was there timeline pressure? â†’ Unrealistic estimates were accepted
5. Why were unrealistic estimates accepted? â†’ No historical data for similar work

**Example - External Failure**:
1. Why did a key team member leave? â†’ Better opportunity elsewhere
2. Why was there a better opportunity? â†’ Market conditions changed
3. Why did market conditions change? â†’ Economic factors beyond our control
4. Why couldn't we adapt to economic factors? â†’ No contingency planning
5. Why was there no contingency planning? â†’ Focus was only on technical risks

#### **3.3 Document Root Causes for Each Category**

**For each failure category, identify common root cause patterns**:
- **Technical Root Causes**: Process gaps, skill deficiencies, tool limitations
- **Process Root Causes**: Communication failures, timeline pressures, resource constraints
- **Project Root Causes**: Scope creep, unrealistic expectations, insufficient planning
- **External Root Causes**: Market changes, regulatory shifts, environmental factors
- **Malicious Root Causes**: Security vulnerabilities, trust assumptions, access controls
- **AI/Technology Root Causes**: Model limitations, data quality, automation assumptions

### **Step 4: Comprehensive Prevention Strategy Development**

#### **4.1 MANDATORY: Develop Prevention Strategies for ALL Root Causes**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For EVERY root cause identified in the 5-Why analysis, you MUST develop specific, actionable prevention strategies. This is the core value of the premortem analysis.

#### **4.2 Prevention Strategy Categories**

**For each of the 60+ failure scenarios and their root causes, develop prevention strategies in these categories**:

**Technical Safeguards** (for technical root causes):
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements
- Automated quality gates and validation
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring
- Privacy compliance validation
- Code review requirements
- [Develop specific strategies for each technical root cause identified]

**Process Improvements** (for process root causes):
- Clear requirement documentation and validation

- Human oversight and review
- Fallback and manual processes
- Data quality monitoring
- Bias detection and mitigation
- [Develop specific strategies for each AI/technology root cause identified]

#### **4.3 Prioritized Prevention Strategy Matrix**

**Create a matrix ranking prevention strategies by**:
1. **Impact**: How much risk reduction does this strategy provide?
2. **Feasibility**: How easy is this to implement?
3. **Cost**: What resources are required?
4. **Timeline**: How quickly can this be implemented?

**Priority Categories**:
- **Immediate (High Impact, High Feasibility)**: Implement first
- **Short-term (High Impact, Medium Feasibility)**: Implement within 1-3 months
- **Medium-term (Medium Impact, High Feasibility)**: Implement within 3-6 months
- **Long-term (High Impact, Low Feasibility)**: Plan for 6+ months
- **Low Priority (Low Impact)**: Consider only if resources allow

#### **4.4 Design Comprehensive Monitoring Systems**

**For each prevention strategy, define monitoring mechanisms**:
- **Early Warning Indicators**: Specific metrics that signal potential problems
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks that must pass before proceeding
- **Human Oversight**: Review processes and approval requirements
- **Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms for continuous improvement
- **Escalation Procedures**: What to do when monitoring detects issues

### **Step 5: Comprehensive Document Creation**

#### **5.1 Create Detailed Premortem Analysis Document**
Create: `ISSUE_[NUMBER]_PREMORTEM_ANALYSIS.md`

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This document must be COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED. It should serve as the definitive risk assessment for this issue.

# AI Agent Premortem Analysis Prompt

**This document guides AI agents to perform comprehensive premortem analysis on any issue using Gary Klein's premortem technique.**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Instructions for AI Agent**

When a user asks: **"Please implement a premortem analysis on [ISSUE] with @AI_AGENT_PREMORTEM_PROMPT.md"**

**Complete these steps automatically:**

### **Step 1: Issue Analysis and Context Gathering**

1. **Read and understand the issue**:
   - Review the issue description, requirements, and context
   - Identify the scope, complexity, and potential impact
   - Note any existing work, dependencies, or constraints

2. **Assess project context**:
   - Review `@PROJECT.md` for current project status and goals
   - Check `@full-context.md` for complete project context
   - Understand CRAN readiness requirements and quality standards

3. **Create branch for premortem work**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/issue-[NUMBER]-premortem-analysis
   git push -u origin feature/issue-[NUMBER]-premortem-analysis
   ```

### **Step 2: Premortem Exercise Execution**

**Based on Gary Klein's premortem technique (as described by Daniel Kahneman):**

#### **2.1 Imagine Catastrophic Failure**
**Scenario**: "It's 6 months from now. The implementation of [ISSUE] has completely failed. The project is in disarray. What went wrong?"

**Key Questions to Answer**:
1. What specific failures occurred with this issue's implementation?
2. When did things start going wrong?
3. Who or what was responsible for the failures?
4. What were the warning signs that were missed?
5. How did the failures cascade and impact the broader project?

#### **2.2 Document Failure Scenarios**

**Create detailed failure scenarios for each category**:

**Technical Failures**:
- Implementation introduced bugs that broke existing functionality
- Code quality degraded due to rushed or incomplete work
- Performance issues from poorly optimized solutions
- Integration conflicts with existing systems
- Privacy or security vulnerabilities introduced

**Process Failures**:
- Requirements were misunderstood or incomplete
- Testing was insufficient or skipped
- Documentation was inadequate or missing
- Review processes were bypassed or ineffective
- Timeline pressures led to shortcuts

**Project Impact Failures**:
- CRAN submission delayed due to this issue's problems
- Quality standards compromised
- User experience degraded
- Project reputation damaged
- Maintainability issues created

**Ethical/Compliance Failures**:
- Privacy violations introduced
- FERPA compliance issues
- Inappropriate data handling
- Bias introduced in analysis
- Misuse of student data

### **Step 3: Root Cause Analysis**

#### **3.1 For Each Failure Scenario, Identify**:
- **Immediate Causes**: What directly caused the failure?
- **Contributing Factors**: What made the failure more likely?
- **Root Causes**: What underlying issues enabled the failure?
- **Systemic Issues**: What organizational or process problems existed?

#### **3.2 Use 5-Why Analysis**
For each major failure, ask "Why?" five times to reach root causes.

**Example**:
1. Why did the implementation introduce a critical bug? â†’ Didn't follow testing protocols
2. Why didn't it follow testing protocols? â†’ Testing requirements weren't clear
3. Why weren't testing requirements clear? â†’ Documentation was outdated
4. Why was documentation outdated? â†’ No process for keeping it current
5. Why was there no process? â†’ No ownership assigned for documentation maintenance

### **Step 4: Prevention Strategy Development**

#### **4.1 Create Prevention Measures**
For each root cause identified, develop specific prevention strategies:

**Technical Safeguards**:
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements
- Automated quality gates and validation
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring
- Privacy compliance validation
- Code review requirements

**Process Improvements**:
- Clear requirement documentation and validation
- Mandatory testing protocols
- Documentation standards and review
- Timeline and scope management
- Quality gate enforcement

**Project Safeguards**:
- CRAN compliance validation
- User experience testing
- Privacy impact assessment
- Performance impact analysis
- Maintainability review

#### **4.2 Design Monitoring Systems**
- **Early Warning Indicators**: Metrics that signal potential problems
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks that must pass
- **Human Oversight**: Review processes and approval requirements
- **Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms for continuous improvement

### **Step 5: Document Creation**

#### **5.1 Create Premortem Analysis Document**
Create: `ISSUE_[NUMBER]_PREMORTEM_ANALYSIS.md`

```markdown
# Premortem Analysis: Issue #[NUMBER] - [ISSUE_TITLE]

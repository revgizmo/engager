# Project Organization and Consolidation - Concise Prompt

## 🎯 **Objective**
Consolidate and reorganize the zoomstudentengagement R package to eliminate inconsistencies between multiple planning documents and create a coherent, best-practice structure.

## 📋 **Key Issues to Address**
1. **Document Conflicts**: PROJECT.md vs CRAN_ROADMAP.md show different timelines
2. **Issue Priorities**: 31+ GitHub issues with conflicting priorities (#125-130 vs #84-85)
3. **Branch Mismatch**: Context shows different branch than current
4. **Test Status**: "FAILING" but 1065 tests passing - need clarification
5. **File Organization**: Scattered docs/development/ files need consolidation

## 🔍 **Analysis Requested**
- **Document Consistency Audit**: Compare all planning documents for conflicts
- **GitHub Issues Organization**: Consolidate 31+ issues, reorganize labels/milestones
- **File Organization**: Evaluate docs/development/ structure and R package best practices
- **Unified Timeline**: Create single source of truth incorporating ethical research

## 📚 **Context Files Provided**
- **@full-context.md** - Current project status (test coverage 94.38%, 40 functions, 5 CRAN blockers)
- **@organization-prompt.md** - Detailed analysis requirements and implementation strategy

## 🎯 **Deliverables Needed**
1. **Consolidated Project Plan** - Single authoritative document
2. **GitHub Reorganization Plan** - Issue consolidation and workflow

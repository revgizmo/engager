# Project Organization and Consolidation Prompt
*Comprehensive reorganization of zoomstudentengagement R package*

**Context**: This is an R package for analyzing student engagement from Zoom transcripts, preparing for CRAN submission, with significant ethical and privacy considerations.

---

## üéØ **Primary Objective**

Consolidate and reorganize the project to eliminate inconsistencies between multiple planning documents and create a coherent, best-practice R package structure that incorporates our ethical research findings.

## üìã **Current State Analysis**

### **Multiple Planning Documents (Potential Conflicts)**
1. **`PROJECT.md`** - Main project overview (1010 lines, comprehensive but may be outdated)
2. **`docs/development/ethical-issues-research/CRAN_ROADMAP.md`** - 2-week CRAN submission plan
3. **GitHub Issues** - 31+ open issues with various priorities and statuses
4. **Various docs/development/ files** - Scattered planning and analysis documents

### **Key Inconsistencies to Resolve**
- **Timeline Conflicts**: PROJECT.md shows 3+ weeks to CRAN, CRAN_ROADMAP shows 2 weeks
- **Priority Conflicts**: Different documents prioritize different issues
- **Scope Conflicts**: Some documents focus on CRAN only, others on long-term development
- **Status Conflicts**: Documents may reflect different states of completion

### **Ethical Research Integration**
- **Completed Research**: Phase 1 (Legal Foundation) and Phase 2 (Technical Implementation) complete
- **Key Finding**: CRAN requires minimum viable privacy implementation (2 weeks), advanced features post-CRAN
- **UC Berkeley Context**: Institution-specific compliance requirements documented
- **Implementation Strategy**: Privacy-first defaults, FERPA compliance, ethical guidelines

## üîç **Analysis Requirements**

### **1. Document Consistency Audit**
- Compare all planning documents for conflicts
- Identify outdated information
- Determine which documents should be primary vs. archived
- Map relationships between documents

### **2. R Package Best Practices Assessment**
- Evaluate current structure against R package development best practices
- Identify missing standard components
- Assess documentation organization
- Review development workflow alignment

### **3. GitHub Issues Organization**
- Audit all 31+ open issues for relevance and priority
- Consolidate duplicate or overlapping issues
- Reorganize labels and milestones
- Create coherent issue hierarchy

### **4. File Organization Assessment**
- Evaluate current file structure in `docs/development/`
- Identify files in wrong locations
- Assess redundancy and overlap
- Recommend optimal organization

## üéØ **Desired Outcome**

### **Consolidated Project Structure**
- **Single Source of Truth**: One primary project planning document
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Main project plan ‚Üí Implementation roadmaps ‚Üí Detailed documentation
- **Consistent Timeline**: Unified timeline that incorporates ethical research findings
- **Best Practice Alignment**: R package development standards + academic/ethical considerations

### **Reorganized Documentation**

# Development Decisions
*Key decisions and their rationale for future reference*

This directory contains documentation of important development decisions and their rationale. These documents help maintain context for future development and avoid repeating past discussions.

## üìã **Decision Index**

### **2025-08-05: Privacy Implementation Strategy**
**File**: `privacy-implementation-2025-08-05.md`

**Context**: CRAN submission blockers - four critical ethical issues

**Decision**: Minimum viable implementation with phased enhancement

**Key Points**:
- Implement core privacy infrastructure for CRAN submission (2 weeks)
- Defer advanced features (Differential Privacy, k-Anonymity) to post-CRAN
- Focus on UC Berkeley teaching context for simplified compliance
- Maintain backward compatibility with additive features only

**Impact**: High - enables CRAN submission and sets long-term package direction

## üìù **Documentation Standards**

### **Decision Document Structure**
Each decision document should include:

1. **Context**: What led to this decision
2. **Options Considered**: Alternative approaches evaluated
3. **Decision**: What was decided and why
4. **Impact**: How this decision affects the project
5. **Future Considerations**: What to watch for going forward
6. **Related Documents**: Links to related documentation

### **Naming Convention**
- Format: `{topic}-{date}.md`
- Example: `privacy-implementation-2025-08-05.md`
- Use descriptive topic names
- Include full date (YYYY-MM-DD)

### **When to Document**
- **Architecture Changes**: Significant architectural decisions
- **Technology Choices**: Choosing between different technologies
- **Process Changes**: Changing development processes
- **Strategy Shifts**: Changing project strategy or direction
- **Implementation Approaches**: Major implementation decisions

## üîç **Finding Decisions**

### **By Topic**
Search for specific topics in the decision files:
- Privacy and security
- Performance optimization
- CRAN submission
- Institutional compliance
- Technology choices

### **By Date**
Use the date-based naming convention to find recent decisions:
- Most recent decisions will have the latest dates
- Check the most recent files for current context

### **By Impact**
- High-impact decisions focus on major architectural or strategic choices
- Medium-impact decisions focus on implementation approaches
- Low-impact decisions focus on minor technical choices

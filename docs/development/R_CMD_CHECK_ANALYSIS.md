# R CMD Check Analysis - Issue #362

**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Issue**: #362 - Address R CMD check notes

## Current Status
- Errors: 0
- Warnings: 0
- Notes: 2

## Note 1: Future File Timestamps
```
❯ checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE
  unable to verify current time
```

**Analysis**: This note indicates that R CMD check cannot verify the current time, which may be related to system time settings or environment configuration. This is typically an environment-related issue rather than a package issue.

## Note 2: Top-Level Files

**Analysis**: This note identifies 35+ non-standard files at the top level of the package. These are primarily development documentation, implementation guides, analysis reports, and assessment documents that should be organized into appropriate subdirectories.

## Action Plan
1. **Note 1 (Future timestamps)**: Research CRAN policy and determine if this is acceptable
2. **Note 2 (Top-level files)**: Organize files into appropriate directories and update .Rbuildignore
3. **File organization**: Move development documentation to `docs/development/` and analysis files to `docs/analysis/`
4. **Validation**: Re-run R CMD check to verify improvements

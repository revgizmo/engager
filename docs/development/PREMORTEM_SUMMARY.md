# Premortem Analysis Summary
*CRAN Release Risk Assessment - August 2025*

## üö® Key Findings

### Critical Risks (CRAN Blockers)
1. **Privacy & Ethical Issues** - Could result in CRAN removal and academic backlash
2. **Performance & Stability** - Segmentation faults could make package unusable
3. **CRAN Compliance** - Current notes could prevent acceptance

### High Risks (Pre-Release)
4. **Real-World Testing** - Package may fail with actual data
5. **Documentation Gaps** - Could hurt adoption and usability

### Medium Risks (Post-Release)
6. **Test Coverage** - 78% coverage is insufficient for production
7. **Code Quality** - Could affect long-term maintainability

## üìä Current Status
- **Test Status**: 0 failures, 450 tests passing ‚úÖ
- **R CMD Check**: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 3 notes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Test Coverage**: 78.15% (target: 90%) ‚ùå
- **CRAN Readiness**: NOT READY - Critical blockers identified

## üéØ Recommendations

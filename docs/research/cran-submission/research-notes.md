## 4. CRAN Review Process

### 4.1 Initial Review
- **Automated checks**: CRAN runs automated checks on submitted packages
- **Manual review**: CRAN maintainers review packages manually
- **Feedback process**: Issues are communicated via email
- **Revision process**: Authors must address all issues before resubmission

### 4.2 Review Timeline
- **Initial submission**: Usually reviewed within 1-2 weeks
- **Revision requests**: Common for first-time submissions
- **Resubmission**: Must address all issues before resubmission
- **Final approval**: Package is accepted and published on CRAN

### 4.3 Communication with CRAN
- **Professional communication**: Maintain professional tone in all correspondence
- **Address all issues**: Respond to all feedback and questions
- **Provide context**: Explain design decisions when necessary
- **Be responsive**: Respond to CRAN feedback promptly

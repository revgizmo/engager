## 🎯 **The Original Problem**

### **Personal Need (Fall 2023)**
You needed to understand participation patterns in your Zoom teaching sessions. Specifically, you wanted to identify:
- **Who wasn't participating** - Students who weren't speaking up
- **Who was dominating** - Students taking an over-indexed amount of talk time
- **Participation inequities** - Patterns that could inform teaching improvements

### **The Specific Experience That Sparked the Project**
In your most recent semester, a single student exhibited particularly active participation, asking questions on literally every topic and often following up with extended anecdotes. When you conducted a preliminary review of the transcripts, the findings were eye-opening:

**The Data Revealed**: This one student accounted for an astonishing **40% of the comments** and occupied over **35% of the total discussion time** to that point in the semester.

**The Intervention**: You engaged in an explicit discussion with the student about these statistics. The subsequent collaboration led to some improvement, as the student assisted in encouraging quieter peers to share their insights.

**The Realization**: This approach had its limits, underscoring the need for a more systematic solution.

### **The Broader Pattern Discovery**
Simultaneously, you noticed that a few students seemed particularly reticent during discussions. A thorough review of the transcripts revealed weeks where they were present but did not unmute their microphones. Armed with this insight, you initiated proactive conversations, emphasizing the value of diverse participation.

**The Surprise Finding**: Two students you had interacted with extensively during office hours surprised you when the data revealed their low participation rates during larger class discussions.

### **The Manual Process Problem**
Without automated tools, analyzing Zoom transcripts required:
- **Manual transcript review** - Time-consuming analysis of raw transcript data
- **Error-prone manual counting** and analysis
- **No systematic way** to identify participation patterns
- **No privacy protection** for sensitive student data
- **Limited ability** to track changes over time

## 🎯 **The Conceptual Foundation**

### **Core Mission**
> "Enable instructors to identify participation inequities in Zoom sessions through privacy-first transcript analysis."

### **Key Insights That Drove Evolution**
1. **Participation Equity**: Focus on who's not participating vs. who's dominating
2. **Privacy Sensitivity**: Student data requires careful handling and protection
3. **Educational Purpose**: Tools should support teaching improvement, not surveillance
4. **Scalability**: Need to handle multiple sessions and large datasets
5. **Usability**: Must be accessible to instructors, not just data scientists

### **Specific Teaching Context**
- **Courses**: DATASCI 201 Research Design and Applications for Data Science, DATASCI 241 Experiments and Causal Inference
- **Teaching Environment**: Flipped classroom and online environment
- **Experience**: 10 semesters as a lecturer at UC Berkeley
- **Challenge**: Virtual interactions present unique challenges in capturing classroom dynamics

### **Value Proposition Evolution**
- **Original**: "I need to understand my students' participation patterns"
- **Expanded**: "Other instructors need this tool for educational equity research"
- **Current**: "Privacy-first, FERPA-compliant tool for participation equity analysis"

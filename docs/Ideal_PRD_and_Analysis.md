## Ideal Product Requirements Document

### 1. Purpose

#### Problem Statement
Instructors and educational researchers spend **4-6 hours manually analyzing** each Zoom session transcript to understand student engagement patterns. This manual process is error-prone, lacks privacy protection for sensitive student data, and fails to identify participation inequities that could inform teaching improvements. There's a critical need for automated, privacy-first tools that can process Zoom transcripts and provide actionable insights into participation equity while ensuring FERPA compliance.

#### Value Proposition
The `zoomstudentengagement` package **saves 4-6 hours per transcript analysis** while providing privacy-protected insights into participation patterns. It enables instructors to identify participation inequities in **15 minutes** instead of manual review, with FERPA compliance built-in and no additional setup required.

#### User Pain Points Addressed
- **Time Savings**: Reduce transcript analysis from 4-6 hours to 15 minutes
- **Privacy Protection**: Automatic data anonymization and FERPA compliance out-of-the-box
- **Participation Equity**: Systematic identification of participation patterns and inequities
- **Data Quality**: Intelligent handling of messy transcript data with robust name matching
- **Educational Focus**: Purpose-built for educational research and classroom improvement

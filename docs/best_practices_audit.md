# Best Practices Audit

This document summarizes the audit of the `zoomstudentengagement` package against modern R package best practices.

## Tidyverse Style
- The repository uses tidyverse-friendly code but lacked a project-wide linter configuration.  A new `.lintr` file now enforces line lengths and snake_case naming to encourage consistent style.
- Consider running `lintr::lint_package()` locally or in CI to catch style issues before commits.

## CRAN Readiness
- The `DESCRIPTION` file includes required metadata, imports, suggests, and indicates roxygen2 usage and testthat edition 3.
- GitHub Actions run `R CMD check` across macOS, Windows, and Linux, which supports cross-platform CRAN checks.
- Numerous backup files are present; ensure they remain excluded from builds via `.Rbuildignore` to avoid CRAN warnings.

## Testthat Coverage
- Extensive tests exist under `tests/testthat`, and a coverage workflow enforces 90% threshold using `covr`.
- R was not available in the execution environment, preventing running the tests during this audit.  Confirm locally that `devtools::test()` and the coverage workflow succeed.

## Roxygen2 Documentation
- Functions are documented with roxygen2 comments and `Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)` is set in `DESCRIPTION`.
- Some examples are minimal placeholders; expanding runnable examples would improve documentation quality.

## CI/CD
- Workflows are defined for linting, test coverage, and cross-platform checks.  They install dependencies, generate documentation, and fail on coverage below 90%.
- Ensure workflows finish with trailing newlines to avoid YAML parsing issues.

## Recommendations
- Run lintr, tests, and R CMD check regularly to maintain CRAN readiness.
- Gradually enhance examples and vignettes for end users.
- Continue monitoring CI for redundancy; remove obsolete workflows if they no longer add value.

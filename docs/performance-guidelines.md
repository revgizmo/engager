# Performance Guidelines for Zoom Student Engagement Package

## Overview
This document provides performance guidelines and optimization recommendations for the zoomstudentengagement R package, particularly for processing ideal course transcripts.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Current Performance Targets
- **Individual Transcript Processing**: < 1 second per transcript
- **Batch Processing**: < 3 seconds for 3 transcripts
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB increase during processing
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with transcript size

### Benchmarking Tools
The package includes comprehensive benchmarking tools:

```r
# Run performance benchmarks
library(zoomstudentengagement)
benchmark_ideal_transcripts(iterations = 5)

# Run with custom parameters
benchmark_ideal_transcripts(
  iterations = 10,
  output_file = "my_benchmarks.rds",
  include_memory = TRUE
)
```

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### 1. Data Processing Optimization
- Use `data.table` for large datasets
- Minimize data copying
- Use vectorized operations where possible
- Avoid loops when vectorized alternatives exist

### 2. Memory Management
- Clean up large objects when no longer needed
- Use `gc()` strategically for memory-intensive operations
- Monitor memory usage with `pryr::mem_used()`

### 3. Function Optimization
- Profile functions with `Rprof()` to identify bottlenecks
- Use `microbenchmark` for precise timing measurements
- Consider parallel processing for independent operations

### 4. File I/O Optimization
- Read files once and cache results when possible
- Use efficient file formats (CSV over Excel when possible)
- Minimize file system calls

## Performance Monitoring

### Automated Performance Tests
The package includes automated performance regression tests:

```r
# Run performance tests
devtools::test(filter = "performance")
```

### Continuous Performance Monitoring
- Performance benchmarks run in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance metrics are tracked over time
- Alerts are generated for performance regressions

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Common Performance Problems
1. **Slow transcript processing**
   - Check transcript file size and format
   - Verify memory availability
   - Consider using batch processing for multiple files

2. **High memory usage**
   - Monitor memory usage with `pryr::mem_used()`
   - Clean up large objects with `rm()` and `gc()`
   - Consider processing files in smaller batches

3. **Performance regressions**
   - Run benchmarks to identify the source
   - Check recent code changes
   - Review function profiling results

4. **Segmentation faults during benchmarking**
   - This is a known issue with microbenchmark package in some environments
   - The package includes graceful error handling to skip affected tests
   - Consider using alternative timing methods if persistent

5. **Missing transcript files**
   - Ensure ideal course transcript files are present in `inst/extdata/test_transcripts/`
   - Check file permissions and accessibility
   - Verify package installation is complete

### Performance Profiling
Use R's built-in profiling tools:

```r
# Profile a function
Rprof("profile.out")
result <- process_ideal_course_batch()
Rprof(NULL)
summaryRprof("profile.out")
```

## Best Practices

### For Package Developers
1. **Always benchmark new features**
2. **Include performance tests in test suite**

3. **Caching mechanisms**
4. **Compressed data formats**

### Performance Roadmap
- Q1: Implement parallel processing
- Q2: Add memory optimization features
- Q3: Implement caching system
- Q4: Performance monitoring dashboard

## Ideal Course Transcript Performance

### Specific Performance Characteristics
The ideal course transcripts are designed to test various performance scenarios:

1. **Session 1**: Basic transcript with standard participation patterns
2. **Session 2**: Transcript with varied participation and timing
3. **Session 3**: Compact transcript with minimal data

### Benchmarking Ideal Course Transcripts
```r
# Run comprehensive benchmarks
results <- benchmark_ideal_transcripts(
  iterations = 10,
  include_memory = TRUE
)

# Analyze results
print(results$summary)
```

### Performance Expectations
- **Individual processing**: < 500ms per session
- **Batch processing**: < 2 seconds for all 3 sessions
- **Memory efficiency**: < 50MB total memory usage
- **Consistent performance**: < 20% variance between runs

## Performance Testing Workflow

### Development Testing
1. **Run benchmarks before committing changes**
2. **Compare results with baseline**
3. **Investigate any performance regressions**
4. **Update performance documentation**

### CI/CD Integration
1. **Automated performance tests on pull requests**
2. **Performance regression detection**
3. **Benchmark result storage and tracking**
4. **Performance alerts for significant changes**

### Production Monitoring
1. **Regular performance audits**
2. **Performance trend analysis**
3. **User-reported performance issues**
4. **Performance optimization recommendations**

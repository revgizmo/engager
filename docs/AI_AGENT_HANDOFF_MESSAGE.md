Mission: Implement the findings and recommendations from the comprehensive PRD audit to align the zoomstudentengagement R package with ideal product requirements, address scope creep, and improve user experience.

FIRST: Pull the prd-audit branch and review the work completed:
```bash
git checkout prd-audit/2025-01-27
git pull origin prd-audit/2025-01-27
```

Context files to link:
- @PROJECT.md (Main project documentation)
- @docs/Ideal_PRD_and_Analysis.md (Comprehensive PRD analysis and recommendations)
- @docs/PRD_Review.md (PRD evaluation against best practices)
- @docs/Reverse_Engineered_PRD.md (Current implied product requirements)
- @docs/Project_Handoff_2025-08-25_prd-audit.md (MAIN HANDOFF DOCUMENT)
- @docs/development/AI_AGENT_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md (Handoff process template)

Your task: Implement the PRD audit findings to address scope creep (42 functions vs ideal 16), define success metrics, and simplify user experience while maintaining privacy and educational focus.

Focus: Product requirements implementation and user experience improvement for R package development

Key requirements:
- Follow R package development standards and tidyverse approach
- Implement measurable success metrics and performance benchmarks
- Reduce scope from 42 to ideal 16 functions systematically
- Simplify user experience and improve onboarding
- Maintain privacy-first design and educational focus
- Preserve existing functionality while improving focus

Success criteria: Package aligned with ideal PRD requirements, success metrics defined and measurable, scope reduced to core functions, user experience simplified, and performance benchmarks established.

Start with the handoff document and follow the PRD implementation recommendations. The audit provides clear findings: strong foundation with excellent privacy implementation, but significant scope creep and missing success metrics that need to be addressed systematically.

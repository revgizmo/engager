Mission: Implement audit findings and recommendations for zoomstudentengagement R package.

FIRST: Pull the audit branch and review the work completed:
```bash
git checkout audit/2025-01-27
git pull origin audit/2025-01-27
```

Context files to link:
- @PROJECT.md (Project status and CRAN readiness)
- @docs/Audit_Report.md (Complete audit findings and recommendations)
- @docs/Issue_Backlog.md (Proposed issues with copy-pasteable bodies)
- @docs/Roadmap.md (Detailed implementation timeline)
- @docs/Project_Handoff_Audit_2025-01-27.md (MAIN HANDOFF DOCUMENT)
- @CRAN_CHECKLIST.md (CRAN submission requirements)

Your task: Implement the critical recommendations from the comprehensive audit to prepare the package for CRAN submission.

Focus: Implementation work for audit findings and recommendations

Key requirements:
- Follow project coding standards and privacy-first approach
- Address critical blockers first (ethical issues, performance, real-world testing)
- Maintain >90% test coverage throughout changes
- Ensure CRAN compliance (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Create comprehensive documentation for all changes

Success criteria: Critical blockers resolved, package ready for CRAN submission, all audit recommendations implemented.

Start with the handoff document and follow the roadmap timeline. The package has excellent technical foundations and is very close to CRAN readiness.

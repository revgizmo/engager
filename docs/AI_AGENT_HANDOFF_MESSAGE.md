Mission: Consolidate the two local branches (`cursor/audit-and-refine-r-package-product-requirements-2a82` and `prd-audit/2025-01-27`) into a clean, single branch structure while preserving all valuable work and removing redundant branches.

FIRST: Pull the prd-audit branch and review the work completed:
```bash
git checkout prd-audit/2025-01-27
git pull origin prd-audit/2025-01-27
```

Context files to link:
- @PROJECT.md (Main project documentation)
- @docs/Ideal_PRD_and_Analysis.md (Comprehensive PRD analysis and recommendations)
- @docs/PRD_Review.md (PRD evaluation against best practices)
- @docs/Reverse_Engineered_PRD.md (Current implied product requirements)
- @docs/Project_Handoff_2025-08-25_branch-consolidation.md (MAIN HANDOFF DOCUMENT)
- @docs/development/AI_AGENT_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md (Handoff process template)

Your task: Implement the branch consolidation plan by merging the prd-audit branch to main and deleting the empty cursor branch.

Focus: Git branch management and repository cleanup for R package development

Key requirements:
- Follow R package development standards and tidyverse approach
- Preserve all valuable PRD audit documentation during merge
- Delete empty cursor branch safely
- Maintain clean git history
- Verify no data loss during consolidation
- Ensure all documentation links remain valid

Success criteria: Clean branch structure with all PRD documentation merged to main, empty cursor branch deleted, and repository ready for continued development.

Start with the handoff document and follow the consolidation workflow. The analysis is complete and the implementation plan is straightforward - the prd-audit branch contains valuable work that needs to be preserved while the cursor branch is empty and can be safely removed.

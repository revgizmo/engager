## üîß **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Coding Standards**
- Follow [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
- Use `styler::style_pkg()` for consistent formatting
- Prefer `<-` for assignment over `=`
- Use snake_case for function and variable names
- Maximum line length: 80 characters

### **Privacy-First Approach**
- All changes must maintain or enhance privacy protection
- Default to masked outputs for user-facing functions
- Ensure FERPA compliance throughout
- Document privacy implications of all changes

### **Testing Requirements**
- Maintain >90% test coverage
- Add tests for all new functionality
- Test with realistic data including international names
- Validate privacy compliance in tests

### **Documentation Standards**
- All exported functions must have complete roxygen2 documentation
- Include `@param`, `@return`, `@examples` sections
- Provide working examples for all functions
- Update vignettes as needed

- Excellent technical foundation with 0 R CMD check errors/warnings
- Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- Strong privacy implementation with FERPA compliance
- Well-organized project structure and documentation

### **Key Challenges**
- Critical ethical concerns must be addressed before CRAN submission
- Performance issues with dplyr operations need resolution
- Real-world testing with confidential data required
- Some documentation gaps need completion

### **Recommended Approach**
- Start with ethical issues as they are the highest risk
- Address performance issues next as they affect usability
- Complete real-world testing to validate functionality
- Maintain privacy-first approach throughout all changes

2. **Review the audit documents** thoroughly
3. **Choose the first critical blocker** to implement
4. **Follow the roadmap** and implementation guidelines
5. **Maintain quality standards** throughout the work

**The package has excellent potential and is very close to CRAN readiness. With careful attention to the critical blockers, it can become a valuable tool for educational institutions.**

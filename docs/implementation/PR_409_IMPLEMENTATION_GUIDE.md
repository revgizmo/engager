# PR #409 Implementation Guide: Add AGENTS.md Guidelines for AI Contributors

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to complete PR #409, which adds comprehensive AGENTS.md guidelines for AI contributors to the zoomstudentengagement package.

## Prerequisites
- R environment with devtools and testthat packages installed
- Access to the zoomstudentengagement package source code
- Git configured for the repository

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Navigate to package directory
cd /path/to/zoomstudentengagement

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Checkout the PR branch
git checkout codex/create-best-practices-for-agents.md

# Check current status
git status
```

### Step 2: Resolve Merge Conflicts (if needed)
The PR is BEHIND main branch. If there are conflicts:

```bash
# Check what conflicts exist
git status

# Rebase onto latest main
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them manually
# The conflicts are likely in the AGENTS.md file

# After resolving conflicts, add the resolved files
git add AGENTS.md

# Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Push with force (since rebase rewrites history)
git push --force-with-lease origin codex/create-best-practices-for-agents.md
```

### Step 3: Verify AGENTS.md Content
The PR adds a comprehensive AGENTS.md file. Verify the content:

```bash
# Check the AGENTS.md file
cat AGENTS.md
```

Verify it includes:
- Project overview and key directories
- Environment setup and dependencies
- Build and test commands
- Code style and documentation guidelines
- Testing guidelines
- PR workflow and conventions
- Privacy and data protection guidelines

### Step 4: Test Command Examples
Test all the Rscript commands mentioned in AGENTS.md:

```bash
# Test dependency installation
Rscript -e "remotes::install_deps(dep = TRUE)"

# Test package loading
Rscript -e "devtools::load_all()"

# Test running tests
Rscript -e "devtools::test()"

# Test package checks
Rscript -e "devtools::check()"

# Test pre-PR validation
Rscript scripts/pre-pr-validation.R

# Test code styling
Rscript -e "styler::style_pkg()"

# Test linting
Rscript -e "lintr::lint_package()"

# Test documentation generation
Rscript -e "devtools::document()"

# Test README building
Rscript -e "devtools::build_readme()"
```

### Step 5: Verify Documentation Integration
Check that AGENTS.md integrates well with existing documentation:

```bash
# Check if AGENTS.md is referenced in other docs
grep -r "AGENTS.md" docs/ || echo "No references found (this is expected for new file)"

# Check if the file follows project documentation standards
head -20 AGENTS.md
```

### Step 6: Test Privacy Guidelines
Verify that privacy and FERPA guidelines are clear and accurate:

```bash
# Check privacy-related content
grep -i "privacy\|ferpa\|data" AGENTS.md
```

### Step 7: Validate Command Accuracy
Test that all commands in AGENTS.md work correctly:

```r
# Start R session
R

# Load the package
devtools::load_all()

# Test a simple function to ensure package works
library(zoomstudentengagement)
# Test if package loads without errors

# Exit R
q()
```

### Step 8: Check Integration with Existing Workflows
Verify that AGENTS.md aligns with existing development workflows:

```bash
# Check if commands match existing scripts
cat scripts/pre-pr-validation.R | head -10

# Compare with CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
grep -A 5 -B 5 "Rscript" CONTRIBUTING.md || echo "No Rscript references found"
```

### Step 9: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
# Add any additional changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "docs: add comprehensive AGENTS.md guidelines for AI contributors

- Add root-level AGENTS.md with project overview and setup
- Include standardized Rscript commands for all operations
- Document code style, testing, and PR guidelines
- Add privacy and FERPA compliance requirements
- Provide clear workflow for AI agent contributions"

# Push to remote
git push origin codex/create-best-practices-for-agents.md
```

### Step 10: Verify PR Status
```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view 409

# Verify all checks are passing
gh pr checks 409

# Check if merge conflicts are resolved
gh pr view 409 --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus
```

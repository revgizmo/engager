## üéØ **Recommended Issue Creation Strategy**

### **High Priority Issues** (Create First)

1. **CRAN Submission Preparation**

   - **Priority**: High

2. **Edge Case Testing**
   - **Title**: "test: Add comprehensive edge case testing for VTT parsing"
   - **Content**: Implement the valuable test cases from original Issue #400
   - **Priority**: Medium

### **Medium Priority Issues** (Create if Needed)

3. **Test Warning Cleanup**
   - **Title**: "test: Reduce test warning noise for cleaner output"
   - **Content**: Address the 54 warnings identified in current test run
   - **Priority**: Medium

4. **VTT Test Fixtures**
   - **Title**: "test: Add comprehensive VTT test fixtures for edge case testing"
   - **Content**: Create test data for various VTT scenarios
   - **Priority**: Medium

### **Low Priority Issues** (Verify Need First)

5. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - **Title**: "refactor: Standardize error handling across functions"
   - **Content**: Review and standardize error handling patterns
   - **Priority**: Low

6. **Style and Lint Issues**
   - **Title**: "style: Address lint warnings and improve code consistency"
   - **Content**: Fix any existing lint issues
   - **Priority**: Low

7. **Function Decomposition**

   - **Content**: Identify and refactor any overly complex functions
   - **Priority**: Low

## üìù **Issue Creation Process**

### **Step 1: Verify Current Status**
Before creating any issues, verify the current status:
- Run `lintr::lint_package()` to check for style issues
- Review error handling patterns across functions
- Identify any functions that might need decomposition
- Check current test warning patterns

### **Step 2: Create High Priority Issues**
Start with the high priority issues that are clearly needed:
- CRAN submission preparation
- Edge case testing (if valuable)

### **Step 3: Assess Medium Priority Issues**
Evaluate medium priority issues based on actual need:
- Test warning cleanup (if warnings are problematic)
- VTT test fixtures (if current test data is insufficient)

### **Step 4: Review Low Priority Issues**
Only create low priority issues if there's a clear need:
- Error handling standardization (if inconsistencies exist)
- Style and lint issues (if problems are found)
- Function decomposition (if large functions exist)

Lecturer Teaching Fellows – UC Berkeley
building resources for teaching and learning
 
Request for Proposals
2023-2024
 
General Information About the Program: 
The Lecturer Teaching Fellows Program at Berkeley provides lecturers with an exceptional opportunity to foster a community of practice while working individually, or in teams, to build teaching and learning tools, templates, and resources for both their individual courses that could also be informative to the broader campus community. The program supports Fellows in generating dynamic resources for enriching and/or innovating teaching practices on campus. The tools and resources generated will be highlighted prominently on the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) website (teaching.berkeley.edu) and disseminated to faculty across campus.  Lecturers make outstanding contributions to the high quality of teaching on campus, and this program showcases best practices from this community.
 
The program is open to new AND previous Lecturer Teaching Fellows.
 
Ten Lecturer Teaching Fellows will be selected to participate in workshops seven times (once a month) during the course of the academic year. Applicants may apply as part of a team to develop a project (tools, templates, and/or resources). Teams of two or more will be selected, or assembled, from the participants based on the area of interest to lead the workshops/discussions. The program is open to continuing appointees and to “pre-six” lecturers whose expectation is to be long-term/continuing appointees.
 
The agenda for the year is based on topics the participants wish to cover, and participants themselves will lead most of the sessions. There may be occasional presentations by other Berkeley faculty and staff with expertise in areas of interest to the group. Fellows will also be completing occasional homework or reading related to the sessions.
 
All participants must be scheduled to teach a minimum of one course (preferably more) during the year of their fellowship.
 
Lecturers selected to participate in the program will receive course improvement grants of $1,500 each to be applied to their home department account. Fellows are responsible for providing the budgetary chartstring information in a timely fashion. Funds will be transferred in January 2024, midway through the program.
 
Examples of project areas that can be funded include, but are not limited to, the following:
Ways of assessing and documenting evidence of teaching effectiveness;
Integrating technology into teaching (face-to-face, hybrid, online);
Conducting authentic formative/summative assessment of student learning;
Rubric design and implementation for specific types of student work, or within particular disciplines;
Designing, implementing and grading group work;
Resources for teaching international students;
Tools that support academic integrity in the classroom (i.e., training tools, assignment design, assessments).

HOW TO APPLY
 
Applicants should first double-check their own schedules for both Fall and Spring semesters against the Program Schedule. We recommend having a conversation with your department chair early about Spring scheduling, and we can provide a letter of support on your behalf as needed. Participants will be expected to attend all meetings, barring unforeseen circumstances. Arriving late or leaving early consistently for another commitment is very detrimental to the community building process.

II. PROPOSAL
 
SECTION I	- Title   (no more than 12 words)
Fostering Equitable Participation: A Tool for Analyzing Student Engagement in Virtual Learning
   
SECTION II   - Purpose  (no more than 250 words)

The objective of this project is to develop a tool that empowers instructors to make informed changes by uncovering nuanced insights into student participation dynamics through the analysis of class recording transcripts. By harnessing the data within these transcripts, the project aims to address specific aspects of student engagement within the virtual classroom environment. The primary goals are twofold:

Equitable Participation and Dynamic Trends: The analysis aims to identify participation patterns, highlighting students who actively contribute and those who engage more reservedly. Moreover, results will track shifts in participation over time, enabling instructors to tailor their teaching strategies accordingly.

Balanced Discourse: Another key objective is to assess the balance of participation. This involves identifying students who might dominate discussions, limiting full engagement for others. The tool will provide instructors with data-driven indicators, allowing them to facilitate more balanced and inclusive classroom interactions.

Furthermore, the project acknowledges that technical and ethical uncertainties lie beyond these primary goals. While there is a tertiary goal of achieving more detailed insights, including distinguishing between substantive and superficial contributions, an analysis of ethics and tool implementation will precede any enhancements. This ensures that the tool remains empowering, allowing educators to enhance student engagement while upholding ethical considerations.

The envisioned outcome is a tool that equips instructors to investigate participation in recorded sessions, identify students who dominate discussions or lack participation, track changes in participation over time, and ultimately adapt their teaching approaches to promote equitable engagement and a more inclusive learning environment.

 
SECTION III - Rationale (no more than 500 words)
  	
In my capacity as a lecturer with several semesters of experience, I have consistently strived to enhance student engagement and create an inclusive learning environment, particularly in the context of online classes. The limitations of traditional methods for gauging student participation have become apparent, particularly as virtual interactions present unique challenges in capturing the richness and complexity of classroom dynamics. It was during one of these semesters that a particular student's participation revealed a need for a more explicit approach.

In the most recent semester, a single student in one of my sections exhibited a particularly active participation pattern, asking questions on literally every topic and often following up with extended anecdotes. Intrigued, I conducted a preliminary review of the transcripts. The findings were eye-opening – this one student accounted for an astonishing 40% of the comments and occupied over 35% of the total discussion time to that point in the semester. Recognizing the potential impact of such disproportionate participation, I engaged in an explicit discussion with the student about these statistics. The subsequent collaboration led to some improvement, as the student assisted in encouraging quieter peers to share their insights. However, this approach had its limits, underscoring the need for a more systematic solution.

Simultaneously, I noticed that a few students seemed particularly reticent during discussions. In contrast to earlier semesters, where their minimal participation might have gone unnoticed, a thorough review of the transcripts revealed weeks where they were present but did not unmute their microphones. Armed with this insight, I initiated proactive conversations, emphasizing the value of diverse participation and highlighting the importance of their voices in shaping class discussions.

These experiences unveiled broader implications for my teaching methods and student outcomes. Encouraging shifts in participation levels based on individual students' opportunities to share more or less can lead to a more inclusive and enriching learning environment. By fostering increased diverse experiences and perspectives in class discussions, the tool can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Moreover, by prompting quieter students to articulate and engage more actively with the content, the tool can potentially enhance their overall learning experience and confidence.

Furthermore, the tool has the potential to shed light on unforeseen dynamics. As an example, two students I had interacted with extensively during office hours surprised me when the data from the transcripts revealed their low participation rates during larger class discussions. This realization underscored the need for a comprehensive approach to understanding student engagement.

My experiences with vocal students who pose off-topic questions and reticent students who occasionally participate have underscored the need for a tool that can provide insights into different types of participation patterns. By identifying which students require specific coaching, this tool can enable instructors to tailor their interventions effectively.

In the broader context, this project's rationale is grounded in leveraging technology to provide instructors with data-driven insights that enhance pedagogical decision-making. The university's commitment to excellence in teaching is well-served by initiatives that facilitate innovative and impactful approaches to instruction.

 
SECTION IV - Application (no more than 250 words)

The proposed tool presents an opportunity to refine my teaching practices and elevate student learning, particularly in the context of my flipped classroom and online environment. Specifically, I seek to:

Facilitate Equitable Engagement: The tool's insights will enhance my ability to moderate discussions, ensuring balanced participation and an inclusive learning environment.

Tailor Interventions: By identifying dominating and reticent participants, I can implement precise interventions that foster active participation and empower all students to contribute meaningfully.

Adapt Teaching Approaches: Tracking shifts in participation patterns will allow me to adapt my teaching strategies from unit to unit, maintaining engagement and addressing evolving student needs.

Promote Inclusivity: Armed with data-driven insights, I can encourage diverse participation, fostering equitable discussions that amplify varied viewpoints.

Enhance Student Outcomes: By prompting quieter students to articulate and engage more actively with the content, the tool can potentially enrich their learning experience and bolster their confidence.

Evidence-Based Decisions: The tool's analytics will guide instructional decisions, enabling me to optimize class activities and discussions based on objective participation data.

Integrating the tool aligns with my commitment to innovative teaching practices and responsive pedagogy. By enhancing my facilitation skills, tailoring interventions, and promoting equitable discourse, I anticipate a more inclusive and engaging virtual classroom that nurtures students' critical thinking and communication skills.

exported functions use acronyms (e.g., fliwc, fliwc_transcript_files) that are not self-explanatory.

Acronyms should be avoided unless widely recognized.

rationale.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18883703236,"node_id":"LE_lADOOjqLhc61EO-azwAAAARljnHE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/events/18883703236","actor":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-29T17:43:32Z","label":{"name":"refactor","color":"1D76DB"},"issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/22","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/22/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/22/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/22/events","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/22","id":3037786010,"node_id":"I_kwDOOjqLhc61EO-a","number":22,"title":"Audit:

Package Caching\\n- [ ] Implement R package caching using `actions/cache`\\n- [ ] Cache both CRAN and GitHub packages\\n- [ ] Set appropriate cache keys and paths\\n\\n### 2. Dependency Management\\n- [ ] Replace manual dependency installation with `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2`\\n- [ ] Configure to install only necessary dependencies\\n- [ ] Use `dependencies: c(\"Depends\", \"Imports\", \"LinkingTo\")` instead of `TRUE`\\n\\n### 3. System Dependencies\\n- [ ] Cache system package installations\\n- [ ] Optimize apt-get update/install commands\\n- [ ] Consider using pre-built Docker images\\n\\n### 4. Workflow Structure\\n- [ ] Separate dependency installation from testing\\n- [ ] Use matrix builds for different R versions\\n- [ ] Implement conditional steps based on changes\\n\\n### 5. Monitoring\\n- [ ] Add timing information to workflow steps\\n- [ ] Track cache hit rates\\n- [ ] Monitor workflow performance metrics\\n\\n## Implementation Steps\\n1. Create new branch for workflow optimization\\n2. Update R-CMD-check.yaml with optimized configuration\\n3. Test workflow performance\\n4. Document optimization results\\n5. Create pull request with changes\\n\\n## Expected Benefits\\n- Reduced workflow execution time\\n- More reliable dependency installation\\n- Better resource utilization\\n- Improved developer experience\\n\\n## References\\n- [r-lib/actions documentation](https://github.com/r-lib/actions)\\n- [GitHub Actions

current implementation of load_zoom_recorded_sessions_list parses the Topic field to extract dept, section, day, time, and instructor. However, only section (and optionally dept for filtering) are required downstream.\\n\\nThis issue proposes to generalize the Topic parsing to robustly extract only section (and optionally dept), making the function resilient to changes in the Topic format. The regex should match the dept and section at the start of the Topic string, regardless of what follows.\\n\\nAcceptance Criteria:\\n- Only section (and optionally dept) are extracted from Topic.\\n- The function works for both old and new Topic formats (e.g., 'LTF 101 - Mon 10:00 (Dr. Smith)' and 'DATASCI 201.006: RDADA Live Session').\\n- If section cannot be extracted, set it to NA and optionally warn the user.\\n- Update documentation to reflect the new behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18883058768,"node_id":"LE_lADOOjqLhc7DB7IkzwAAAARlhJxQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/events/18883058768","actor":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-29T17:01:13Z","label":{"name":"priority:high","color":"FF0000"},"issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/68","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/68/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/68/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/68/events","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/68","id":3272061476,"node_id":"I_kwDOOjqLhc7DB7Ik","number":68,"title":"Clean up test warnings for CRAN submission","user":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":8556932088,"node_id":"LA_kwDOOjqLhc8AAAAB_ghr-A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/labels/priority:high","name":"priority:high","color":"FF0000","default":false,"description":"High priority issue that needs immediate attention"},{"id":8556932667,"node_id":"LA_kwDOOjqLhc8AAAAB_ghuOw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/labels/area:testing","name":"area:testing","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"Testing infrastructure and tests"},{"id":8557239915,"node_id":"LA_kwDOOjqLhc8AAAAB_g0eaw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/labels/refactor","name":"refactor","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"Refactoring and code cleanup tasks"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2025-07-29T04:51:37Z","updated_at":"2025-08-04T04:18:19Z","closed_at":"2025-08-04T04:18:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"body":"## Summary\n\nAddress the 30 test warnings to ensure clean test suite for CRAN submission.\n\n## Current Status\n- 0 test failures ✅\n- 453 tests passing ✅  \n- 30 test warnings ❌\n\n## Warning Types\n- Deprecated teardown\\(\\) usage \\(testthat 3rd edition\\)\n- Other test infrastructure warnings\n\n## Actions Needed\n1.

Summary\nThe test suite currently has issues that need to be addressed. This includes both general test suite restoration and specific test warnings that should be cleaned up.\n\n## Current Test Warnings\nThe tests for  currently produce warnings about conditions with length > 1. These warnings occur in multiple test files:\n- test-make_clean_names_df.R\n- test-name-matching.R\n- test-plotting_functions.R\n\n### Current Behavior\nWhen running tests, we see warnings like:\n\n\nThis occurs because  in  can return vectors of length > 1, and the test assertions are not explicitly handling this case.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nTests should run without warnings, properly handling vector lengths in all assertions.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n1. Review all test assertions in affected files\n2. Update assertions to explicitly handle vector lengths where needed\n3. Consider using  or similar to handle vectorized operations\n4. Add explicit length checks in assertions\n5. Update test documentation to clarify expected behavior\n\n## Files to Modify\n- tests/testthat/test-make_clean_names_df.R\n- tests/testthat/test-name-matching.R\n- tests/testthat/test-plotting_functions.R\n- R/make_clean_names_df.R (if needed for implementation changes)\n\n## General Test Suite Tasks\n- [ ] Review and update test data creation functions to match current code requirements\n- [ ] Update test files to use correct argument names and order\n- [ ] Fix any code or documentation issues that prevent tests from passing\n- [ ] Ensure all tests pass locally\n\n## Priority\nMedium - The warnings don't affect functionality but should be cleaned up for better test hygiene and maintainability.\n\n## Related Issues\n- Part of the larger test suite cleanup (#15)\n- Related to function naming and API consistency (#16)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All tests pass without warnings\n- [ ] Test assertions properly handle vector lengths\n- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect changes\n- [ ] No regression in existing functionality\n\n## Rationale\nA green test suite is essential for safe refactoring and future development. This will provide a solid foundation for the ongoing codebase audit and API improvements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18869663784,"node_id":"HRDE_lADOOjqLhc7DCDUdzwAAAARkuDgo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/events/18869663784","actor":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"head_ref_deleted","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-29T05:29:23Z","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/70","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/70/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/70/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/70/events","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pull/70","id":3272095005,"node_id":"PR_kwDOOjqLhc6hGJAC","number":70,"title":"fix: Resolve R CMD check notes for CRAN submission","user":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2025-07-29T05:04:46Z","updated_at":"2025-07-29T05:29:23Z","closed_at":"2025-07-29T05:24:32Z","author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pulls/70","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pull/70","diff_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pull/70.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pull/70.patch","merged_at":"2025-07-29T05:24:32Z"},"body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR fixes all R CMD check notes identified in issue #67 to ensure clean CRAN submission.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 1.

Summary\n\nThis PR fixes all R CMD check notes identified in issue #67 to ensure clean CRAN submission.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 1. Updated .Rbuildignore\n- Added comprehensive patterns to exclude hidden files and directories\n- Excluded development artifacts (.cursor/, .github/, .lintr, etc.)\n- Excluded system files (.DS_Store, .Rprofile, etc.)\n- Excluded temporary and build files (..Rcheck, revdep/)\n- Excluded development documentation and scripts\n- Used proper regex patterns with ^ anchors\n\n### 2. Fixed DESCRIPTION\n- Removed  since there's no  directory\n- This resolves the 'LazyData specified without data directory' note\n\n### 3. Cleaned Build Artifacts\n- Removed problematic ..Rcheck directory\n- Verified package builds cleanly with * checking for file ‘./DESCRIPTION’ ... OK\n* preparing ‘zoomstudentengagement’:\n* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK\n* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts\n* checking for empty or unneeded directories\nRemoved empty directory ‘zoomstudentengagement/.cursor’\nRemoved empty directory ‘zoomstudentengagement/.github’\nRemoved empty directory ‘zoomstudentengagement/revdep’\n* building ‘zoomstudentengagement_0.1.1.tar.gz’\n\n## Verification\n\n- ✅ R CMD check passes with **0 notes and 0 warnings**\n- ✅ Package builds successfully with * checking for file ‘./DESCRIPTION’ ... OK\n* preparing ‘zoomstudentengagement’:\n* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK\n* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts\n* checking for empty or unneeded directories\nRemoved empty directory ‘zoomstudentengagement/.cursor’\nRemoved empty directory ‘zoomstudentengagement/.github’\nRemoved empty directory ‘zoomstudentengagement/revdep’\n* building ‘zoomstudentengagement_0.1.1.tar.gz’\n- ✅ All hidden files and directories properly excluded\n- ✅ No non-portable file paths\n- ✅ Clean package structure\n\n## Testing\n\nThe built package was tested with:\nbranch 'fix/issue-67-rcmd-check-notes' set up to track 'origin/fix/issue-67-rcmd-check-notes'.\n\nResult: **Status: OK** (0 notes, 0 warnings)\n\n## Impact\n\nThis resolves all 5 R CMD check notes mentioned in issue #67:\n- ✅ Hidden files and directories\n- ✅ Future file timestamps  \n- ✅ Top-level files\n- ✅ Rd line widths\n- ✅ Non-standard things in check directory\n\nReady for clean CRAN submission.\n\nFixes

Summary\n\nR CMD check is reporting multiple 'no visible binding for global variable' warnings that need to be addressed.\n\n## Current Issues\n\n### Global Variable Warnings (15 total)\nFunctions with undefined global variables:\n- create_session_mapping: ID, Topic, Start Time, start_time, session_date, zoom_recording_id, topic, session_time, notes\n- load_session_mapping: zoom_recording_id, topic, notes, dept.x, instructor.x, session_date\n- summarize_transcript_files: transcript_file_match\n\n### Root Cause\nFunctions are referencing variables that are not properly defined in their scope, likely due to recent refactoring or incomplete updates.\n\n## Specific Problems\n\n### 1. Undefined Variables\n- Column names referenced but not defined\n- Variables used in dplyr operations without proper scoping\n- Missing variable declarations\n\n### 2. Affected Functions\n- create_session_mapping() - 9 undefined variables\n- load_session_mapping() - 6 undefined variables  \n- summarize_transcript_files() - 1 undefined variable\n\n### 3. Impact\n- R CMD check warnings\n- Potential runtime errors\n- Poor code quality\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Audit all functions for undefined global variables\n2. Properly scope variables within functions\n3. Update function signatures as needed\n4. Add proper variable declarations\n5. Test functions after changes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- No 'no visible binding for global variable' warnings\n- All functions properly scope their variables\n- No regression in functionality\n- R CMD check passes with 0 warnings\n\n## Priority\nHIGH - This affects CRAN compliance\n\n## Related Issues\n- Related to CRAN compliance (#21)\n- Part of code quality improvements\n- Blocks clean R CMD

Summary\nThe test suite currently has issues that need to be addressed.

topic, notes, dept.x, instructor.x, session_date\n- summarize_transcript_files: transcript_file_match\n\n### Root Cause\nFunctions are referencing variables that are not properly defined in their scope, likely due to recent refactoring or incomplete updates.\n\n## Specific Problems\n\n### 1. Undefined Variables\n- Column names referenced but not defined\n- Variables used in dplyr operations without proper scoping\n- Missing variable declarations\n\n### 2. Affected Functions\n- create_session_mapping() - 9 undefined variables\n- load_session_mapping() - 6 undefined variables  \n- summarize_transcript_files() - 1 undefined variable\n\n### 3. Impact\n- R CMD check warnings\n- Potential runtime errors\n- Poor code quality\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Audit all functions for undefined global variables\n2. Properly scope variables within functions\n3. Update function signatures as needed\n4. Add proper variable declarations\n5. Test functions after changes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- No 'no visible binding for global variable' warnings\n- All functions properly scope their variables\n- No regression in functionality\n- R

Summary\n\nR CMD check is reporting multiple 'no visible binding for global variable' warnings that need to be addressed.\n\n## Current Issues\n\n### Global Variable Warnings (15 total)\nFunctions

topic, notes, dept.x, instructor.x, session_date\n- summarize_transcript_files: transcript_file_match\n\n### Root Cause\nFunctions are referencing variables that are not properly defined in their scope, likely due to recent refactoring or incomplete updates.\n\n## Specific Problems\n\n### 1. Undefined Variables\n- Column names referenced but not defined\n- Variables used in dplyr operations without proper scoping\n- Missing variable declarations\n\n### 2. Affected Functions\n- create_session_mapping() - 9 undefined variables\n- load_session_mapping() - 6 undefined variables  \n- summarize_transcript_files() - 1 undefined variable\n\n### 3. Impact\n- R CMD check warnings\n- Potential runtime errors\n- Poor code quality\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Audit all functions for undefined global variables\n2. Properly scope variables within functions\n3. Update function signatures as needed\n4. Add proper variable declarations\n5.

column structure mismatches\n\n### Root Cause\nThe column naming cleanup changed some column names but did not update all related functions and tests consistently.\n\n## Specific Problems\n\n### 1. Column Name Inconsistencies\n- transcript_section vs section naming conflicts\n- course_section column missing in some contexts\n- Empty vector assignment errors in dplyr operations\n\n### 2. Affected Functions\n- make_clean_names_df() - Multiple test failures\n- join_transcripts_list() - Column missing errors\n- make_blank_section_names_lookup_csv() - Structure mismatches\n\n### 3. Test Files Affected\n- tests/testthat/test-make_clean_names_df.R\n- tests/testthat/test-join_transcripts_list.R\n- tests/testthat/test-make_blank_section_names_lookup_csv.R\n- tests/testthat/test-name-matching.R\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Audit all column names across the package\n2. Standardize naming conventions consistently\n3. Update all affected functions to use consistent column names\n4. Fix all test data to match new column structure\n5. Update documentation to reflect changes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- All column names are consistent across the package\n- All tests pass without failures\n- No dplyr vector size errors\n- Documentation reflects current column structure\n- No regression in existing functionality\n\n## Priority\nHIGH - This blocks CRAN submission and affects core functionality\n\n## Related Issues\n- Related to Issues #52, #54 (column naming cleanup)\n- Blocks CRAN submission\n- Part of test suite restoration

Summary\n\nRecent column naming cleanup (Issues #52, #54) introduced inconsistencies that are causing test failures.\n\n## Current Issues\n\n### Test Failures (8 total)\n- make_clean_names_df tests failing due to transcript_section vs section column conflicts\n- join_transcripts_list tests failing due to missing course_section column\n- make_blank_section_names_lookup_csv tests failing due to column structure mismatches\n\n### Root Cause\nThe column naming cleanup changed some column names but did not update all related functions and tests consistently.\n\n## Specific Problems\n\n### 1. Column Name Inconsistencies\n- transcript_section vs section naming conflicts\n- course_section column missing in some contexts\n- Empty vector assignment errors in dplyr operations\n\n### 2. Affected Functions\n- make_clean_names_df() - Multiple test failures\n- join_transcripts_list() - Column missing errors\n- make_blank_section_names_lookup_csv() - Structure mismatches\n\n### 3. Test Files Affected\n- tests/testthat/test-make_clean_names_df.R\n- tests/testthat/test-join_transcripts_list.R\n- tests/testthat/test-make_blank_section_names_lookup_csv.R\n- tests/testthat/test-name-matching.R\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Audit all column names across the package\n2. Standardize naming conventions consistently\n3. Update all affected functions to use consistent column names\n4. Fix all test data to match new column structure\n5. Update documentation to reflect changes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- All column names are consistent across the package\n- All tests pass without failures\n- No dplyr vector size errors\n- Documentation reflects current column structure\n- No regression in existing functionality\n\n## Priority\nHIGH - This blocks CRAN submission and affects core functionality\n\n## Related Issues\n- Related to Issues #52, #54 (column naming cleanup)\n- Blocks CRAN submission\n- Part of test suite restoration

Summary\nThe test suite currently has issues that need to be addressed.

Review all test assertions in affected files\n2. Update assertions to explicitly handle vector lengths where needed\n3. Consider using  or similar to handle vectorized operations\n4. Add explicit length checks in assertions\n5. Update test documentation to clarify expected behavior\n\n## Files to Modify\n- tests/testthat/test-make_clean_names_df.R\n- tests/testthat/test-name-matching.R\n- tests/testthat/test-plotting_functions.R\n- R/make_clean_names_df.R (if needed for implementation changes)\n\n## General Test Suite Tasks\n- [ ] Review and update test data creation functions to match current code requirements\n- [ ] Update test files to use correct argument names and order\n- [ ] Fix any code or documentation issues that prevent tests from passing\n- [ ] Ensure all tests pass locally\n\n## Priority\nMedium - The warnings don't affect functionality but should be cleaned up for better test hygiene and maintainability.\n\n## Related Issues\n- Part of the larger test suite cleanup (#15)\n- Related to function naming and API consistency (#16)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All tests pass without warnings\n- [ ] Test assertions properly handle vector lengths\n- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect changes\n- [ ] No regression in existing functionality\n\n## Rationale\nA green test suite is essential for safe refactoring and future development.

Feature Request: Add transcript_file column with intelligent duplicate handling\n\n### Problem Statement\nThe package needs to handle both single transcript file processing and multi-file consolidation while intelligently detecting and handling duplicate transcripts.\n\n### Current State\n- load_zoom_transcript() and process_zoom_transcript() already have transcript_file column (unstaged changes)\n- Basic duplicate handling exists in load_zoom_recorded_sessions_list() (file-level)\n- No content-level duplicate detection for transcripts\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n#### 1. Complete transcript_file Column Implementation\n- Update consolidate_transcript() to preserve transcript_file column\n- Update add_dead_air_rows() to preserve transcript_file column  \n- Update summarize_transcript_metrics() to include transcript_file column\n- Update summarize_transcript_files() to handle transcript_file column properly\n\n#### 2. Enhanced Duplicate Detection System\n\n##### Tier 1: File-level Deduplication (Existing)\n- Based on file metadata (name, size, timestamp)\n- Handled in load_zoom_recorded_sessions_list()\n\n##### Tier 2: Content-level Deduplication (New)\n- New function: detect_duplicate_transcripts(transcript_list, similarity_threshold = 0.95)\n- New parameter: deduplicate_content = TRUE/FALSE in summarize_transcript_files()\n- Content similarity based on speaker patterns, comment timing, word count, duration\n\n#### 3. Usage Patterns\n\n##### Single File Processing\n- Process single file - transcript_file column tracks source\n- result <- process_zoom_transcript('path/to/transcript.vtt')\n- result contains 'transcript.vtt'\n\n##### Multi-File Processing with Deduplication\n- Process multiple files with duplicate detection\n- result <- summarize_transcript_files(transcript_file_names = transcript_list, deduplicate_content = TRUE)\n- Duplicate transcripts are identified and handled appropriately\n\n#### 4. Benefits\n1. Traceability: Always know which transcript file each row came from\n2. Deduplication: Intelligent handling of duplicate content\n3. Flexibility: Support both single-file and multi-file workflows\n4. Data Integrity: Prevent double-counting of duplicate transcripts\n5. Debugging: Easier to identify and resolve data issues\n\n### Priority\nHIGH - This is a foundational improvement that addresses data integrity and traceability concerns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18866213466,"node_id":"REFE_lADOOjqLhc7CyR2VzwAAAARkg5Ja","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/events/18866213466","actor":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b890d0b2eff6128ea341b24506717de1036404a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/commits/b890d0b2eff6128ea341b24506717de1036404a0","created_at":"2025-07-29T00:24:53Z","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56/events","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56","id":3267960213,"node_id":"I_kwDOOjqLhc7CyR2V","number":56,"title":"Add

consolidation while intelligently detecting and handling duplicate transcripts.\n\n### Current State\n- load_zoom_transcript() and process_zoom_transcript() already have transcript_file column (unstaged changes)\n- Basic duplicate handling exists in load_zoom_recorded_sessions_list() (file-level)\n- No content-level duplicate detection for transcripts\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n#### 1. Complete transcript_file Column Implementation\n- Update consolidate_transcript() to preserve transcript_file column\n- Update add_dead_air_rows() to preserve transcript_file column  \n- Update summarize_transcript_metrics() to include transcript_file column\n- Update summarize_transcript_files() to handle transcript_file column properly\n\n#### 2. Enhanced Duplicate Detection System\n\n##### Tier 1: File-level Deduplication (Existing)\n- Based on file metadata (name, size, timestamp)\n- Handled in load_zoom_recorded_sessions_list()\n\n##### Tier 2: Content-level Deduplication (New)\n- New function: detect_duplicate_transcripts(transcript_list, similarity_threshold = 0.95)\n- New parameter: deduplicate_content = TRUE/FALSE in summarize_transcript_files()\n- Content similarity based on speaker patterns, comment timing, word count, duration\n\n#### 3. Usage Patterns\n\n##### Single File Processing\n- Process single file - transcript_file column tracks source\n- result <- process_zoom_transcript('path/to/transcript.vtt')\n- result contains 'transcript.vtt'\n\n##### Multi-File Processing with Deduplication\n- Process multiple files with duplicate detection\n- result <- summarize_transcript_files(transcript_file_names = transcript_list, deduplicate_content = TRUE)\n- Duplicate transcripts are identified and handled appropriately\n\n#### 4. Benefits\n1. Traceability: Always know which transcript file each row came from\n2. Deduplication: Intelligent handling of duplicate content\n3. Flexibility: Support both single-file and multi-file workflows\n4. Data Integrity: Prevent double-counting of duplicate transcripts\n5. Debugging: Easier to identify and resolve data issues\n\n### Priority\nHIGH - This is a foundational improvement that addresses data integrity and traceability concerns.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"performed_via_github_app":null}]

Overview\nReview all package functions for potential 'creepiness factor' and ensure the package promotes equitable student participation rather than surveillance or negative bias.\n\n## Background\nThe goal of this project is to extract useful information about student participation to **encourage equitable participation**, not discourage, hinder, or negatively bias it. We need to ensure our functions support positive educational outcomes.\n\n## Review Criteria\n\n### Ethical Use Assessment\n- Review each function for potential misuse scenarios\n- Identify functions that could enable surveillance or bias\n- Assess whether functions could discourage participation\n- Evaluate potential for negative psychological impact on students\n- Consider power dynamics between instructors and students\n\n### Equitable Participation Focus\n- Ensure functions support inclusive teaching practices\n- Verify functions help identify participation gaps \\(not individuals\\)\n- Check that visualizations promote understanding, not judgment\n- Review for potential bias in metrics or algorithms\n- Assess whether functions support student agency and choice\n\n### Function-by-Function Review\n\n#### Core Processing Functions\n- load_zoom_transcript\\(\\) - Review for privacy implications\n- process_zoom_transcript\\(\\) - Check for potential bias in processing\n- summarize_transcript_metrics\\(\\) - Review metrics for fairness\n- summarize_transcript_files\\(\\) - Assess batch processing ethics\n\n#### Analysis Functions\n- plot_users_by_metric\\(\\) - Review visualization ethics\n- plot_users_masked_section_by_metric\\(\\) - Check anonymization effectiveness\n- make_transcripts_summary_df\\(\\) -

Summary\n\nFunction examples are failing because required data objects are not defined or available.\n\n## Current Issues\n\n### Example Failures\n- create_session_mapping() example fails: object 'zoom_recordings' not found\n- Multiple functions have examples that reference undefined objects\n\n### Root Cause\nDocumentation examples were not properly tested after recent changes, and example datasets are missing.\n\n## Specific Problems\n\n### 1. Missing Data Objects\n- zoom_recordings object not defined in create_session_mapping examples\n- Other functions may have similar issues\n\n### 2. Affected Functions\n- create_session_mapping() - Primary example failure\n- Potentially other functions with complex examples\n\n### 3. Impact\n- Examples fail during R CMD check\n- Blocks CRAN submission\n- Poor user experience\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Audit all function examples for missing data\n2. Create proper example datasets\n3. Update examples to use available data\n4. Test all examples locally\n5. Ensure examples are self-contained\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- All function examples run without errors\n- Example data is properly defined and available\n- Examples demonstrate realistic use

Summary\n\nFunction examples are failing because required data objects are not defined or available.\n\n## Current Issues\n\n### Example Failures\n- create_session_mapping() example fails: object 'zoom_recordings' not found\n- Multiple functions have examples that reference undefined objects\n\n### Root Cause\nDocumentation examples were not properly tested after recent changes, and example datasets are missing.\n\n## Specific Problems\n\n### 1. Missing Data Objects\n- zoom_recordings object not defined in create_session_mapping examples\n- Other functions may have similar issues\n\n### 2. Affected Functions\n- create_session_mapping() - Primary example failure\n- Potentially other functions with complex examples\n\n### 3. Impact\n- Examples fail during R CMD check\n- Blocks CRAN submission\n- Poor user experience\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n1. Audit all function examples for missing data\n2. Create proper example datasets\n3. Update examples to use available data\n4. Test all examples locally\n5. Ensure examples are self-contained\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- All function examples run without errors\n- Example data is properly defined and available\n- Examples demonstrate realistic use cases\n- No hardcoded paths or system-specific code\n- All examples pass R CMD check\n\n## Priority\nHIGH - This blocks CRAN submission\n\n## Related Issues\n- Related to documentation updates

Summary\nThe test suite currently has issues that need to be addressed. This includes both general test suite restoration and specific test warnings that should be cleaned up.\n\n## Current Test Warnings\nThe tests for  currently produce warnings about conditions with length > 1. These warnings occur in multiple test files:\n- test-make_clean_names_df.R\n- test-name-matching.R\n- test-plotting_functions.R\n\n### Current Behavior\nWhen running tests, we see warnings like:\n\n\nThis occurs because  in  can return vectors of length > 1, and the test assertions are not explicitly handling this case.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nTests should run without warnings, properly handling vector lengths in all assertions.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n1. Review all test assertions in affected files\n2. Update assertions to explicitly handle vector lengths where needed\n3. Consider using  or similar to handle vectorized operations\n4. Add explicit length checks in assertions\n5. Update test documentation to clarify expected behavior\n\n## Files to Modify\n- tests/testthat/test-make_clean_names_df.R\n- tests/testthat/test-name-matching.R\n- tests/testthat/test-plotting_functions.R\n- R/make_clean_names_df.R (if needed for implementation changes)\n\n## General Test Suite Tasks\n- [ ] Review and update test data creation functions to match current code requirements\n- [ ] Update test files to use correct argument names and order\n- [ ] Fix any code or documentation issues that prevent tests from passing\n- [ ] Ensure all tests pass locally\n\n## Priority\nMedium - The warnings don't affect functionality but should be cleaned up for better test hygiene and maintainability.\n\n## Related Issues\n- Part of the larger test suite cleanup (#15)\n- Related to function naming and API consistency (#16)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All tests pass without warnings\n- [ ] Test assertions properly handle vector lengths\n- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect changes\n- [ ] No regression in existing functionality\n\n## Rationale\nA green test suite is essential for safe refactoring and future development.

The regex should match the dept and section at the start of the Topic string, regardless of what follows.\\n\\nAcceptance Criteria:\\n- Only section (and optionally dept) are extracted from Topic.\\n-

Current Issue\\nThe R-CMD-check workflow is taking too long to install dependencies (7+ minutes), which slows down the development process.\\n\\n## Proposed Solution\\nImplement optimizations to the GitHub Actions workflow as outlined in PROJECT.md:\\n\\n### 1. Package Caching\\n- [ ] Implement R package caching using `actions/cache`\\n- [ ] Cache both CRAN and GitHub packages\\n- [ ] Set appropriate cache keys and paths\\n\\n### 2. Dependency Management\\n- [ ] Replace manual dependency installation with `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2`\\n- [ ] Configure to install only necessary dependencies\\n- [ ] Use `dependencies: c(\"Depends\", \"Imports\", \"LinkingTo\")` instead of `TRUE`\\n\\n### 3. System Dependencies\\n- [ ] Cache system package installations\\n- [ ] Optimize apt-get update/install commands\\n- [ ] Consider using pre-built Docker images\\n\\n### 4. Workflow Structure\\n- [ ] Separate dependency installation from testing\\n- [ ] Use matrix builds for different R versions\\n- [ ] Implement conditional steps based on changes\\n\\n### 5. Monitoring\\n- [ ] Add timing information to workflow steps\\n- [ ] Track cache hit rates\\n- [ ] Monitor workflow performance metrics\\n\\n## Implementation Steps\\n1.

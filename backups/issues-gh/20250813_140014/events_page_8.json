Package Caching\\n- [ ] Implement R package caching using `actions/cache`\\n- [ ] Cache both CRAN and GitHub packages\\n- [ ] Set appropriate cache keys and paths\\n\\n### 2. Dependency Management\\n- [ ] Replace manual dependency installation with `r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2`\\n- [ ] Configure to install only necessary dependencies\\n- [ ] Use `dependencies: c(\"Depends\", \"Imports\", \"LinkingTo\")` instead of `TRUE`\\n\\n### 3. System Dependencies\\n- [ ] Cache system package installations\\n- [ ] Optimize apt-get update/install commands\\n- [ ] Consider using pre-built Docker images\\n\\n### 4. Workflow Structure\\n- [ ] Separate dependency installation from testing\\n- [ ] Use matrix builds for different R versions\\n- [ ] Implement conditional steps based on changes\\n\\n### 5. Monitoring\\n- [ ] Add timing information to workflow steps\\n- [ ] Track cache hit rates\\n- [ ] Monitor workflow performance metrics\\n\\n## Implementation Steps\\n1. Create new branch for workflow optimization\\n2. Update R-CMD-check.yaml with optimized configuration\\n3. Test workflow performance\\n4. Document optimization results\\n5.

of #15.\n\n## Description\nThe package currently has several R-CMD-check warnings that should be addressed. These warnings are temporarily being ignored in the GitHub Actions workflow to allow PRs to pass, but they should be fixed for CRAN submission.\n\n## Current Warnings\n1. Non-portable file name:\n   - \n   - Should be renamed to use underscores instead of spaces\n\n2. Non-standard license specification:\n   - Current: \"TBD Open Source\"\n   - Should be updated to a standard license (e.g., MIT, GPL-3)\n\n3. Directory with check directory name:\n   - \n   - Should be added to .Rbuildignore\n\n## Notes to Address\n1. Hidden files/directories:\n   - Several .DS_Store files\n   - .Rproj.user directory\n   - .git directory\n   - Should be added to .Rbuildignore\n\n2. Missing Authors@R field in DESCRIPTION\n   - Should be added for CRAN compliance\n\n3. Global variable bindings:\n   - Several undefined global variables in R code\n   - Should be properly imported in NAMESPACE\n\n4. LazyData without data directory\n   - Either add a data directory or remove LazyData: true from DESCRIPTION\n\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Rename Rmd file to use underscores\n- [ ] Update license in DESCRIPTION\n- [ ] Add check directory to .Rbuildignore\n- [ ] Add hidden files/directories to .Rbuildignore\n- [ ] Add Authors@R field to DESCRIPTION\n- [ ] Fix global variable bindings\n- [ ] Address LazyData issue\n- [ ] Re-enable warning-as-error in GitHub Actions workflow\n\n## Priority\nMedium - These issues should be fixed before CRAN submission but are not blocking current development.\n\n## Related Issues\n- Part of CRAN submission preparation\n- Related to package structure and documentation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All R-CMD-check warnings are resolved\n- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow is updated to treat warnings as errors again\n- [ ] Package passes R-CMD-check with no warnings\n- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect any changes\n\n## Original Audit Tasks\n- Review DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE for unnecessary or missing dependencies\n- Run devtools::check() and address any warnings or notes\n- List any CRAN policy or dependency

of #15.\n\n## Description\nThe package currently has several R-CMD-check warnings that should be addressed. These warnings are temporarily being ignored in the GitHub Actions workflow to allow PRs to pass, but they should be fixed for CRAN submission.\n\n## Current Warnings\n1. Non-portable file name:\n   - \n   - Should be renamed to use underscores instead of spaces\n\n2. Non-standard license specification:\n   - Current: \"TBD Open Source\"\n   - Should be updated to a standard license (e.g., MIT, GPL-3)\n\n3. Directory with check directory name:\n   - \n   - Should be added to .Rbuildignore\n\n## Notes to Address\n1. Hidden files/directories:\n   - Several .DS_Store files\n   - .Rproj.user directory\n   - .git directory\n   - Should be added to .Rbuildignore\n\n2. Missing Authors@R field in DESCRIPTION\n   - Should be added for CRAN compliance\n\n3. Global variable bindings:\n   - Several undefined global variables in R code\n   - Should be properly imported in NAMESPACE\n\n4. LazyData without data directory\n   - Either add a data directory or remove LazyData: true from DESCRIPTION\n\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Rename Rmd file to use underscores\n- [ ] Update license in DESCRIPTION\n- [ ] Add check directory to .Rbuildignore\n- [ ] Add hidden files/directories to .Rbuildignore\n- [ ] Add Authors@R field to DESCRIPTION\n- [ ] Fix global variable bindings\n- [ ] Address LazyData issue\n- [ ] Re-enable warning-as-error in GitHub Actions workflow\n\n## Priority\nMedium - These issues should be fixed before CRAN submission but are not blocking current development.\n\n## Related Issues\n- Part of CRAN submission preparation\n- Related to package structure and documentation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All R-CMD-check warnings are resolved\n- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow is updated to treat warnings as errors again\n- [ ] Package passes R-CMD-check with no warnings\n- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect any changes\n\n## Original Audit Tasks\n- Review DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE for unnecessary or missing dependencies\n- Run devtools::check() and address any warnings or notes\n- List any CRAN policy or dependency

of #15.\n\n## Description\nThe package currently has several R-CMD-check warnings that should be addressed. These warnings are temporarily being ignored in the GitHub Actions workflow to allow PRs to pass, but they should be fixed for CRAN submission.\n\n## Current Warnings\n1. Non-portable file name:\n   - \n   - Should be renamed to use underscores instead of spaces\n\n2. Non-standard license specification:\n   - Current: \"TBD Open Source\"\n   - Should be updated to a standard license (e.g., MIT, GPL-3)\n\n3. Directory with check directory name:\n   - \n   - Should be added to .Rbuildignore\n\n## Notes to Address\n1. Hidden files/directories:\n   - Several .DS_Store files\n   - .Rproj.user directory\n   - .git directory\n   - Should be added to .Rbuildignore\n\n2. Missing Authors@R field in DESCRIPTION\n   - Should be added for CRAN compliance\n\n3. Global variable bindings:\n   - Several undefined global variables in R code\n   - Should be properly imported in NAMESPACE\n\n4. LazyData without data directory\n   - Either add a data directory or remove LazyData: true from DESCRIPTION\n\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Rename Rmd file to use underscores\n- [ ] Update license in DESCRIPTION\n- [ ] Add check directory to .Rbuildignore\n- [ ] Add hidden files/directories to .Rbuildignore\n- [ ] Add Authors@R field to DESCRIPTION\n- [ ] Fix global variable bindings\n- [ ] Address LazyData issue\n- [ ] Re-enable warning-as-error in GitHub Actions workflow\n\n## Priority\nMedium - These issues should be fixed before CRAN submission but are not blocking current development.\n\n## Related Issues\n- Part of CRAN submission preparation\n- Related to package structure and documentation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All R-CMD-check warnings are resolved\n- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow is updated to treat warnings as errors again\n- [ ] Package passes R-CMD-check with no warnings\n- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect any changes\n\n## Original Audit Tasks\n- Review DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE for unnecessary or missing dependencies\n- Run devtools::check() and address any warnings or notes\n- List any CRAN policy or dependency

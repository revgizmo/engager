defaults MVP\n\nSummary\n- Implemented privacy defaults without API churn.\n- .onLoad sets options(zoomstudentengagement.privacy_level = \"mask\") if unset.\n- Added ensure_privacy() and set_privacy_defaults().\n\nIntegrations\n- summarize_transcript_metrics(): applies ensure_privacy() before return.\n- plot_users_by_metric(): masks data before plotting.\n- write_transcripts_summary(): writes masked data and returns it invisibly.\n- write_transcripts_session_summary(): now writes masked data and returns it invisibly.\n- write_engagement_metrics(): applies ensure_privacy() prior to export processing.\n\nTests\n- Added privacy-defaults tests: plot data masked, writers masked, summarize masked by default.\n- Added masking assertions for write_engagement_metrics() CSV and return value.\n- Adjusted summarize_transcript_metrics tests to set privacy \"none\" where asserting raw names.\n\nDocs\n- README: new Privacy Defaults section; lists default masked columns.\n- Vignette: Ethical & FERPA Guide updated to list masked columns.\n- Roxygen: @seealso cross-links between ensure_privacy() and set_privacy_defaults().\n- .Rbuildignore

🎉 Issue #141 Implementation Complete!\n\n### What This PR Does\nImplements automated PROJECT.md metrics updates to eliminate drift between actual project status and documented status.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Single Source Metrics**: `scripts/context-for-new-chat.R` emits `.cursor/metrics.json`\n- **Integrated Updater**: `update_project_metrics()` function in `scripts/save-context.sh`\n- **Two-Step Workflow**: `--check-project-md` (dry-run) → `--fix-project-md` (apply)\n- **Safety First**: Automatic backups, clear diff output, cross-platform compatibility\n- **Updated Prompts**: Context scripts guide users to automated workflow\n\n### Commands Available\n```bash\n# Check if updates needed (safe dry-run)\n./scripts/save-context.sh --check-project-md\n\n# Apply updates (with backup)\n./scripts/save-context.sh --fix-project-md\n\n# Show help\n./scripts/save-context.sh --help\n```\n\n### What Gets Updated Automatically\n- ✅ Last updated date\n- ✅ Package status \n- ✅ Test suite counts\n- ✅ R CMD check notes\n- ✅ Test coverage percentage\n\n### Testing Results\n- ✅ Check command shows clear diff when changes needed\n- ✅ Fix command applies changes and creates backup\n- ✅ Check command shows \"up to date\" after fix\n- ✅ Cross-platform (uses awk not sed -i)\n- ✅ Robust error handling and validation\n\n### Files Changed\n- `scripts/context-for-new-chat.R` - Added metrics JSON emission\n- `scripts/save-context.sh` - Added update_project_metrics() function and flags\n- `scripts/get-context.sh` - Updated prompts to reference automated updater\n- `docs/development/CONTEXT_SCRIPTS_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Added comprehensive documentation\n- `CONTEXT_SCRIPTS_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Updated with final implementation plan\n\n### Definition of Done: ✅ ACHIEVED\nAll success criteria from the enhancement plan have been met.\n\n**Fixes

Problem\n\nPROJECT.md is severely out of date and misleading:\n\n### Current Issues\n- **Test Coverage**: Claims 78.15% but actual is 93.82% ✅\n- **Test Suite**: Claims 450 tests but actual is 1065 tests ✅  \n- **R CMD Check**: Claims 3 notes but actual is 2 notes ✅\n- **Issue Count**: Claims 31 issues but actual is 37 issues\n- **Status**: Claims 'CRITICAL BLOCKERS' but tests are PASSING\n- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-04 (outdated metrics from July)\n\n### Script Limitations\nThe current  only updates:\n-  section\n-  section\n\n**It does NOT update:**\n- Test coverage metrics\n- Test suite counts\n- R CMD check notes\n- Overall status assessment\n- Issue count claims\n- Last updated date\n\n## Solution\n\nEnhance the  script to:\n\n1. **Pull current metrics from R context script**\n2. **Update all metric sections, not just issue lists**\n3. **Update the overall status assessment**\n4. **Update the last updated date**\n5. **Integrate with GitHub CLI for accurate issue counts**\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Update PROJECT.md manually with current metrics\n2. **Phase 2**: Enhance save-context script to automate updates\n3. **Phase 3**: Test and validate the enhanced script\n4. **Phase 4**: Document the new functionality\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] PROJECT.md reflects current metrics (93.82% coverage, 1065 tests, etc.)\n- [ ] Enhanced script updates all relevant sections\n- [ ] Script pulls metrics from R context automatically\n- [ ] Script updates GitHub issue counts accurately\n- [ ] Script updates last modified date\n- [ ] Documentation updated for new functionality\n\n## Priority\n**HIGH** - PROJECT.md is the primary project status document and must be accurate for CRAN submission planning.\n\n## Labels\nenhancement,

Race Condition with Temp Files\n**Problem**: Fixed temp file paths created conflicts when multiple instances run concurrently.\n**Solution**: Use unique temp files with timestamps to avoid race conditions.\n\n### 2.

CRITICAL: Performance Optimization for Large Datasets\n\n**Priority**: High  \n**Type**: Enhancement  \n**Area**: Core  \n**CRAN Impact**: Important (not blocking)\n\n### Description\nOptimize performance for large datasets and implement memory-efficient processing.\n\n### Current Status\n✅ **Segmentation Fault Investigation Complete** (Issue #113)\n- dplyr segmentation faults in package test environment have been investigated\n- Root cause identified: package test environment memory management issues\n- **Solution implemented**: Replaced problematic dplyr operations with stable base R equivalents\n- **All tests now pass** without segfaults\n\n### Remaining Performance Work\n- [ ] Implement alternative approaches for large datasets\n- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring\n- [ ] Create performance benchmarks\n- [ ] Implement chunked processing for large files\n- [ ] Optimize data.table operations for large transcript files\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Performance benchmarks established\n- Large file handling optimized\n- Memory usage documented\n- Chunked processing implemented\n\n### Estimated Time\n3-5 days (reduced from 1 week since segfault investigation is complete)\n\n### CRAN Impact\n**NOT a blocker** - Package is stable and functional. Performance optimization is enhancement for production use.\n\n### Related Issues\n- #113: Investigate dplyr segmentation faults in package test environment ✅ **RESOLVED**\n\n### Premortem Analysis\nOriginally identified as HIGH risk, now **MEDIUM risk** since core functionality is stable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18998309116,"node_id":"REFE_lADOOjqLhc7D7z4izwAAAARsYzD8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/events/18998309116","actor":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"368ff95fa80bb254a49ff86e3872419c08a7e9c5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/commits/368ff95fa80bb254a49ff86e3872419c08a7e9c5","created_at":"2025-08-05T19:19:44Z","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/113","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/113/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/113/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/113/events","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/113","id":3287236130,"node_id":"I_kwDOOjqLhc7D7z4i","number":113,"title":"Investigate dplyr segmentation faults in package test environment","user":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":8552908841,"node_id":"LA_kwDOOjqLhc8AAAAB_csIKQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New feature or request"},{"id":8556932318,"node_id":"LA_kwDOOjqLhc8AAAAB_ghs3g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/labels/priority:low","name":"priority:low","color":"00FF00","default":false,"description":"Low priority issue"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2025-08-03T14:36:52Z","updated_at":"2025-08-05T04:38:35Z","closed_at":"2025-08-05T04:38:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"body":"## Problem Description\n\nDuring package development, we encountered consistent segmentation faults when using dplyr operations within the package test environment. These segfaults occur during devtools::test\\(\\) but not during manual testing.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **dplyr works fine in isolation** - Basic operations, complex operations, and even the exact same operations work when tested manually\n- **Segfaults are specific to package test environment** - They happen during devtools::test\\(\\) but not during interactive sessions\n- **Segfaults are consistent and reproducible** - They happen every time we try to use dplyr in the package context\n- **Issue appears related to memory management** - Segfaults happen in dplyr_lazy_vec_chop_impl suggesting internal memory handling issues\n\n## Affected Functions\n\nThe following functions were affected by dplyr segfaults:\n- process_zoom_transcript.R - dplyr::arrange and dplyr::mutate with dplyr::row_number and dplyr::case_when\n- consolidate_transcript.R - dplyr::lag operations\n- load_roster.R - dplyr::filter operations\n- load_zoom_transcript.R - dplyr::mutate operations\n- make_clean_names_df.R - dplyr::mutate operations\n- write_section_names_lookup.R - dplyr::summarise operations\n- make_names_to_clean_df.R - dplyr::summarise operations\n- make_roster_small.R - dplyr::mutate operations\n- make_sections_df.R - dplyr::mutate and dplyr::group_by/dplyr::summarise operations\n- make_student_roster_sessions.R - dplyr::mutate operations\n- make_students_only_transcripts_summary_df.R - dplyr::filter operations\n- make_transcripts_summary_df.R - dplyr::summarise and dplyr::mutate operations\n- make_transcripts_session_summary_df.R - dplyr::summarise and dplyr::mutate operations\n- mask_user_names_by_metric.R - dplyr::mutate with dplyr::row_number and dplyr::coalesce\n- plot_users_by_metric.R - dplyr::filter within ggplot2::labs call\n- summarize_transcript_files.R - dplyr::mutate with dplyr::row_number\\(\\) and dplyr::if_else\n\n## Current Status\n\n- **Temporary Solution**: Replaced problematic dplyr operations with base R equivalents\n- **All functions now work reliably** with base R operations\n- **Package passes all tests** without segfaults\n- **CRAN submission ready** with stable base R code\n\n## Future Investigation Needed\n\n### Possible Causes to Investigate:\n1. **Memory corruption in package environment** - Something in package loading or test environment corrupting memory\n2. **Version conflicts** - Version conflicts between packages that only manifest during testing\n3. **Test environment setup** - Test environment might have different memory management than interactive sessions\n4. **Package-specific interactions** - Some combination of package functions causing memory issues\n\n### Investigation Steps:\n1. **Memory profiling** - Use tools like profmem or pryr::mem_used\\(\\) to track memory usage\n2. **Package dependency analysis** - Check for version conflicts between dplyr, rlang, vctrs, tidyselect\n3. **Test environment isolation** - Create minimal reproducible examples\n4. **Alternative dplyr approaches** - Test different dplyr patterns and see if some work while others don't\n5. **System-level debugging** - Use tools like lldb or valgrind for deeper analysis\n\n### Priority:\n- **Low priority** - Current base R solution is stable and functional\n- **Future enhancement** - Investigate when time permits\n- **CRAN submission** - Not blocking, can be addressed in future releases\n\n## Related Issues\n- #111 - Critical: Resolve dplyr + lubridate::period segmentation faults

Properly classified as future enhancement (low priority)\n- **Updated Issue #127** - Changed from \"CRITICAL bug\" to \"Performance Optimization for Large Datasets\"\n- **Corrected labels** - Removed misleading \"priority:high\" and \"bug\" labels from resolved issues\n\n#### Documentation Updates\n- **Created ** - Comprehensive plan reflecting current reality\n- **Updated ** - Added critical note about R command execution\n\n#### Status Clarification\n- **Confirmed segfaults are RESOLVED** - Base R workarounds are working (462 tests passing)\n- **Confirmed package is CRAN-ready** -

These segfaults occur during devtools::test\\(\\) but not during manual testing.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **dplyr works fine in isolation** - Basic operations, complex operations, and even the exact same operations work when tested manually\n- **Segfaults are specific to package test environment** - They happen during devtools::test\\(\\) but not during interactive sessions\n- **Segfaults are consistent and reproducible** - They happen every time we try to use dplyr in the package context\n- **Issue appears related to memory management** - Segfaults happen in dplyr_lazy_vec_chop_impl suggesting internal memory handling issues\n\n## Affected Functions\n\nThe following functions were affected by dplyr segfaults:\n- process_zoom_transcript.R - dplyr::arrange and dplyr::mutate with dplyr::row_number and dplyr::case_when\n- consolidate_transcript.R - dplyr::lag operations\n- load_roster.R - dplyr::filter operations\n- load_zoom_transcript.R - dplyr::mutate operations\n- make_clean_names_df.R - dplyr::mutate operations\n- write_section_names_lookup.R - dplyr::summarise operations\n- make_names_to_clean_df.R - dplyr::summarise operations\n- make_roster_small.R - dplyr::mutate operations\n- make_sections_df.R - dplyr::mutate and dplyr::group_by/dplyr::summarise operations\n- make_student_roster_sessions.R - dplyr::mutate operations\n- make_students_only_transcripts_summary_df.R - dplyr::filter operations\n- make_transcripts_summary_df.R - dplyr::summarise and dplyr::mutate operations\n- make_transcripts_session_summary_df.R - dplyr::summarise and dplyr::mutate operations\n- mask_user_names_by_metric.R - dplyr::mutate with dplyr::row_number and dplyr::coalesce\n- plot_users_by_metric.R - dplyr::filter within ggplot2::labs call\n- summarize_transcript_files.R - dplyr::mutate with dplyr::row_number\\(\\) and dplyr::if_else\n\n## Current Status\n\n- **Temporary Solution**: Replaced problematic dplyr operations with base R equivalents\n- **All functions now work reliably** with base R operations\n- **Package passes all tests** without segfaults\n- **CRAN submission ready** with stable base R code\n\n## Future Investigation Needed\n\n### Possible Causes to Investigate:\n1. **Memory corruption in package environment** - Something in package loading or test environment corrupting memory\n2. **Version conflicts** - Version conflicts between packages that only manifest during testing\n3. **Test environment setup** - Test environment might have different memory management than interactive sessions\n4. **Package-specific interactions** - Some combination of package functions causing memory issues\n\n### Investigation Steps:\n1. **Memory profiling** - Use tools like profmem or pryr::mem_used\\(\\) to track memory usage\n2. **Package dependency analysis** - Check for version conflicts between dplyr, rlang, vctrs, tidyselect\n3. **Test environment isolation** - Create minimal reproducible examples\n4. **Alternative dplyr approaches** - Test different dplyr patterns and see if some work while others don't\n5. **System-level debugging** - Use tools like lldb or valgrind for deeper analysis\n\n### Priority:\n- **Low priority** - Current base R solution is stable and functional\n- **Future enhancement** - Investigate when time permits\n- **CRAN submission** - Not blocking, can be addressed in future releases\n\n## Related Issues\n- #111 - Critical: Resolve dplyr + lubridate::period segmentation faults \\(RESOLVED\\)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18982913334,"node_id":"CE_lADOOjqLhc7EMNAQzwAAAARreEU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/events/18982913334","actor":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-05T04:38:34Z","state_reason":null,"issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/132","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/132/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/132/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/issues/132/events","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pull/132","id":3291533328,"node_id":"PR_kwDOOjqLhc6iHXW6","number":132,"title":"fix: Correct dplyr segfault issue prioritization and status","user":{"login":"revgizmo","id":38236082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjM2MDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38236082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revgizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2025-08-05T04:38:28Z","updated_at":"2025-08-05T04:38:36Z","closed_at":"2025-08-05T04:38:34Z","author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pulls/132","html_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pull/132","diff_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pull/132.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/revgizmo/zoomstudentengagement/pull/132.patch","merged_at":"2025-08-05T04:38:34Z"},"body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR corrects the prioritization and status of dplyr segmentation fault issues that were already resolved.\n\n### Changes Made\n\n#### Issue Management Corrections\n- **Reopened Issue #113** -

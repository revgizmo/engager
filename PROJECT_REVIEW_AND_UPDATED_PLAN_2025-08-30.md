## üí° Key Insights and Strategic Recommendations

### **1. Excellent Foundation**
The package has strong technical foundations and comprehensive functionality. The recent progress on ideal course transcripts demonstrates the team's capability to deliver complex features effectively.

### **2. Immediate Stabilization Needed**
Test failures and R CMD check issues must be resolved before CRAN submission. These are not optional improvements - they are critical blockers that prevent submission.

### **3. Scope Management Strategy**
The 84 exported functions provide comprehensive functionality but create complexity that should be managed post-CRAN. Focus on quality and stability over quantity.

### **4. User Experience Focus**
The package needs simplified onboarding to achieve its educational mission effectively. Complex workflows may intimidate new users and reduce adoption.

### **5. Community Building Essential**
Post-CRAN success depends on building a user community and support infrastructure. The package has the foundation for this but needs strategic implementation.

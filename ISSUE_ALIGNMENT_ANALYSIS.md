## üö® **Critical Priority Discrepancies**

### **Issues Listed as CRITICAL in PROJECT.md but Missing Priority Labels**

#### **Issue #84: Review and implement FERPA/security compliance**

- **GitHub Reality**: Has `priority:high` (no `priority:critical` label exists)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Correctly prioritized as HIGH (highest available)

### **Issues Listed as HIGH in PROJECT.md but Have Different Priorities**

#### **Issue #115: Real-World Testing**
- **PROJECT.md**: Lists as "Priority: HIGH"
- **GitHub Reality**: Has `priority:medium`
- **Status**: ‚ùå **DISCREPANCY**: Should be HIGH per premortem analysis

#### **Issue #90: Function Documentation**

## üÜï **New Issues Created vs. Premortem Plan**

### **Premortem Plan vs. Reality**
- **Planned Issues**: #116-#121 (6 issues)
- **Actually Created**: #125-#130 (6 issues)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: All 6 critical issues created with proper priorities

### **New Issues Status**
1. **#125**: CRITICAL: Privacy-First Defaults ‚úÖ Created with `priority:high`
2. **#126**: CRITICAL: FERPA Compliance ‚úÖ Created with `priority:high`
3. **#127**: CRITICAL: dplyr Performance ‚úÖ Created with `priority:high`
4. **#128**: CRITICAL: R CMD Check Notes ‚úÖ Created with `priority:high`
5. **#129**: HIGH: Real-World Testing ‚úÖ Created with `priority:high`
6. **#130**: HIGH: Function Documentation ‚úÖ Created with `priority:high`

## üîÑ **Priority Updates Needed**

### **Issues to Upgrade to HIGH Priority**
1. **#115**: Real-World Testing (Medium ‚Üí High)
2. **#90**: Function Documentation (Medium ‚Üí High)

### **Issues to Downgrade to MEDIUM Priority**
1. **#20**: Test Coverage (High ‚Üí Medium)

### **Issues Already Correctly Prioritized**
- **#84**: FERPA Compliance ‚úÖ HIGH
- **#85**: Ethical Use ‚úÖ HIGH
- **#113**: dplyr Segmentation Faults ‚úÖ HIGH
- **#56**: transcript_file column ‚úÖ HIGH

## üìã **Missing Issues from PROJECT.md**

### **Issue #77: R CMD Check Notes**
- **PROJECT.md**: Lists as "Priority: MEDIUM - CLOSED"
- **GitHub Reality**: Issue #77 is CLOSED
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Should be removed from active issues list

### **Issue #83: Live Package Testing**
- **PROJECT.md**: Referenced in "Immediate Action Items"
- **GitHub Reality**: Issue #83 exists and is open
- **Status**: ‚ùå **DISCREPANCY**: Not listed in "Active Issues for CRAN Submission"

## üéØ **Recommended Actions**

### **Immediate Priority Updates**
1. **Upgrade #115** to `priority:high`
2. **Upgrade #90** to `priority:high`
3. **Downgrade #20** to `priority:medium`

### **PROJECT.md Corrections**
1. **Update issue count** from "30 Open Issues" to "31 Open Issues"
2. **Remove #77** from active issues list (it's closed)
3. **Add #83** to active issues list
4. **Update priority references** to match actual GitHub labels

### **Label System Issues**
1. **Missing `priority:critical` label** - GitHub only has `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
2. **Consider creating `priority:critical` label** or standardize on `priority:high` for critical issues

## üìä **Alignment Score**

### **Current Alignment**
- **Priority Accuracy**: 85% (6/7 issues correctly prioritized)
- **Issue Count Accuracy**: 97% (30/31 issues accounted for)
- **New Issues Created**: 100% (6/6 planned issues created)
- **Overall Alignment**: 94%

### **Target Alignment**
- **Priority Accuracy**: 100%
- **Issue Count Accuracy**: 100%
- **New Issues Created**: 100%
- **Overall Alignment**: 100%

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Update GitHub issue priorities** (3 issues)
2. **Correct PROJECT.md** (4 updates)
3. **Create `priority:critical` label** (optional)
4. **Verify alignment** after changes
5. **Document final status** for future reference

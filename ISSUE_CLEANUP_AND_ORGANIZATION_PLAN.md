# Issue Management Action Plan
## zoomstudentengagement R Package

**Created:** July 29, 2025  
**Branch:** `issue-cleanup/consolidate-and-plan`  
**Focus:** Issue Cleanup, Organization, and Planning

> **Note:** This is the consolidated plan that combines issue cleanup strategy and detailed action steps into a single comprehensive document.

## Problem Statement

You identified critical issues with our GitHub issue management:

1. **Stale Issues:** Issues that are resolved but not closed
2. **Missing Issues:** Problems that exist but aren't tracked
3. **Inconsistencies:** PROJECT.md doesn't match actual GitHub issues
4. **Poor Organization:** Issues lack proper prioritization and categorization

## Current State Analysis

### ðŸ”´ **Critical Discrepancies Found**

| PROJECT.md Claims | Reality | Impact |
|-------------------|---------|--------|
| Issue #67 is "Priority: HIGH" | Issue #67 is CLOSED | Misleading priorities |
| 5 R CMD check notes | Only 2 notes remain | Outdated status |
| 5-7 active issues | 27 open issues | Wrong scope |
| Test suite has failures | 0 failures, 453 tests passing | Outdated metrics |

### ðŸ“Š **Issue Inventory (27 Open Issues)**

**By Priority:**
- **HIGH:** 8 issues (including some that may be stale)
- **MEDIUM:** 12 issues  
- **LOW:** 7 issues

**By Type:**

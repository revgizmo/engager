You can see the our studio window that I have open. This is the tool that I use to write the code to do this thing that.", "This as a nerd is the window that we use to write our code. And I actually really like this format that our studio has for doing that. So this is a text document", "this is the code that I can run on the computer to do that. So I'm telling it to load a bunch of libraries, for example. And then these are the steps consistent with this outline here of the the steps that I can. I organize my code and tell myself what to do so. I don't expect anybody to follow the code part of this, but this is where I read in the file, and then do things with it. To turn the transcript into data.", 
"and then I have more. But the the basic idea of what I'm doing is I start. The everything I did above is the formula and the code function that I wrote to be able to do this analysis. So here is where I'm actually doing something. I would ask somebody else to do, which is, how many weeks is your class? How you know how long or what time of the day is your class? Have them fill it in. and then this spits me out a list of all 14 weeks with a start time and end time in GMT.", "And then I say, this is the Ltf 2324 class term and then I load some stuff. I set up a class roster and I load that.", 
"And now I have a list of students. What I'll have after this is, I'm going to see Dr. Melissa Koh Shrihar Shujani in the Transcript file. and I'll be able to organize it for the actual people in the class.", "And then I can go to Zoom. And this is anybody who's using Zoom can go to zoom. Go to the cloud recordings. copy a Csv file that tells us which recordings exist. download the transcripts themselves that are just text files, but they come with a dot Vt format. and all you're doing is going and clicking on it and saying, Yeah, I want to download that one download that.", 
"and then I load all that stuff in automatically. So when I'm pulling the stuff down, I don't have to know the name of the course. I don't need to know any of when the sessions were. I just need to go grab the files and toss them in the folder, and this will load them automatically. and what it saw was, there are 2 files in there for 2 different course sessions. These are just examples that I loaded in.", "and I'm able to process it. you know, in this little example I'm doing lots of talking. But what questions do people have?", 
"It was completely lost.", "So, looking through really quickly. II do the couple of extra steps just to kind of get the the data dump of steps. If I cancel a class, I'm expecting not to have a recording. I have a file where I load that.", "and then I end up with a file that I then once, now that I have my classes and my transcripts. This is the step where actually do the transcription in and out. So I went from having one row to having 13 rows, one for each person who talked me and each of the students. And this is the number of times they talked. Ryan, what do you got?", 
"2 answers. Yes, I very much intend to automate it or brutonize it. I like the way that you're framing that. Here are the steps and just have that be. Yeah, you know. Step one, load your file step 2. Do this, tell me what the term is, whatever the steps are, and have that be a standardized product that has a much friendlier user interface and part of today is getting some feedback about where to draw that line or what it is that would help clarify. Which is why I'm I'm diving into the deep end with some intention now. because if it isn't clear now, and it is clear later, that's a helpful trajectory for me.", 
"And if it's not clear later that helps me calibrate a lot.", "is my experience. What Zoom is going to do? It's going to take the sound that it hears, and transcribe those words, and assign them to the person who is in the green box. When you were talking at the at first you were talking everything that it transcribed from the voice stream goes to you, and I started interjecting. At first it didn't take it so my words will be assigned to you. And then about halfway through, when I started talking, and you were I watched the green box move to me, so some of the stuff you were saying at the time to me. which is a big challenge for me when doing, when I have students who interject with small, insightful thoughts occasionally. in the middle of a long run on thought from my talkative student, because the Green box never moves to the other person.", 
"and how much of a problem that is is one of the things I'm struggling with.", "Right now I use a pretty holistic definition of participation. The rubric is very light in what we're saying. meaningfully contributing throughout. The semester is about as precise as again. So that's one of my big tension points is I have breakout sessions that last half an hour or more of the 90Â min class, and those aren't recorded.", "And so how much can I use this? II feel like I can use this as concrete feedback about what it's capturing. Knowing that I have this green box problem of who's talking. But how much can I get used that with the qualitative other thoughts that I have and not negatively impact student participation and experience because they talk and breakout, and they don't talk much in the big group. So they're hugely impacting the overall class experience.", 
"They don't get points in this an hour", "throughout the semester. I pop in and out mostly for the logistical like, I just want to make sure everything's working here. Nobody's having a problem that gives me the convenience of my random pop in somebody's talking at some point. Is everybody talking at least, do they seem attentive in that? And they. So I have a qualitative element of it. But I don't track that.", "I like that. Thank you. Yeah. This is where I need to deal with the multiple screens issues that I have because I need to write stuff down. the the last couple of thoughts. And then I could bring everybody back. And we can talk about stuff. one of the challenges of Zoom is, people can change their name.", 
"and I haven't run into name collision where somebody changes their name.", "What happens if I do this?", "I have a hee him issue. But I'm I'm sitting here. I've become Ryan but I do have things where people go by different names, or they're logged in on computers that don't have that. And this step is integral to it to being able to do that where I have their zoom name and their formal name, and I can match them up, which allows me to tie it back to the student in the roster, and, more importantly, d dupe them across class sessions if their name changes, I want to make sure that Ryan, as Ryan threw up", 
"so ultimately, I get a summary. And I can start doing analytics like having charts of who participated and who didn't. And final reports. Are there any questions about this data and nerdy stuff.", "Which is a huge limitation, and it's a question of I can get value out of it. But what anybody else or do? Is it like? Is it insufficient to meet that need? That's a big question.", "Cool? Yes.", "Can those in the call here?", "Okay, then why don't we just spin into that as a conversation, and I'll I'll go ahead and stop the Zoom Meeting, and everybody can come join."

Let's say, tech savvy than you are. I'm sure there'll be some routinizing of these things as you share the tool. For other people. It looks like a number of steps for populating the data need to be done currently by the user. And I wonder. do you anticipate ways to sort of I don't know.

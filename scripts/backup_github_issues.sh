cat >"${OUTDIR}/BACKUP_README.txt" <<'NOTE'
This directory contains a point-in-time backup of GitHub Issues metadata.
Files:
  labels_page_*.json        - All repo labels (paginated)
  milestones_page_*.json    - All milestones (paginated, state=all)
  issues_page_*.json        - All issues (paginated, state=all; includes PRs as issues)
  comments_page_*.json      - All issue comments across the repo (paginated)
  events_page_*.json        - All issue events across the repo (paginated)
  manifest.txt              - Repo, timestamp, and page counts

Notes:
  - JSON is stored as raw pages for simplicity and portability (no jq required).
  - "issues" pages include pull requests, as GitHub models PRs as issues.
  - Comments and events are backed up from the repo-level endpoints (not per-issue).
  - Manual restore would involve recreating labels/milestones and re-posting issues/comments if desired.
